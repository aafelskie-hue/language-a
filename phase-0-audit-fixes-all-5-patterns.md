# Phase 0 Audit Fixes — 5 Failed Patterns Rewritten

These five patterns failed Research Verification during the Phase 0 batch audit of the live 100 patterns on language-a.com. Each has been rewritten with verified evidence from primary sources. The spatial solutions are largely preserved — the issue in every case was either fabricated/unverifiable evidence or a pattern that described social policy rather than spatial design.

**Instructions for Claude Code:** Replace the `evidence`, `problem`, and `therefore` fields in `data/patterns.json` for each pattern below. The "Changes from current version" section at the end of each pattern documents exactly what changed and why — do not include that section in the published pattern.

# 50. Community Land Trust ★★

**…within The Identifiable Neighborhood (41), Common Ground (42), The Missing Middle (12)…**

## Problem

**When land and buildings are sold together on the open market, every transaction inflates the land value, housing becomes unaffordable within a generation, and the community that built the neighborhood is displaced by the wealth it created. The physical fabric suffers too — market pressure pushes every lot toward its highest-value use, eliminating shared gardens, community workshops, and the mix of housing types that makes a neighborhood work for people at different life stages and income levels.**

## Evidence and Discussion

The mechanism is well-established: a Community Land Trust (CLT) separates land ownership from building ownership. The trust holds the land permanently; residents own or lease the buildings. When a homeowner sells, resale restrictions keep the next purchase affordable, recycling a single public investment in perpetuity rather than losing it at first resale.

The Champlain Housing Trust in Burlington, Vermont — founded in 1984 and now the largest CLT in the United States — stewards over 2,400 rental units, 600 ownership homes, and 115 housing cooperatives across three counties. But the numbers matter less than the *physical result*: because no individual lot is being maximized for resale value, the trust can develop mixed housing types, retain community spaces, and plan for long-term neighborhood coherence rather than short-term return.

The spatial evidence is clearest where CLTs have developed from scratch. The Sawmill Community Land Trust in Albuquerque transformed a 27-acre former industrial site into a neighborhood of 196 homes — live-work lofts, detached houses, townhouses, duplexes, and senior apartments — organized around a plaza, park, community center, and trails connecting to open space. That physical diversity of housing types, anchored by shared civic spaces, is what market-rate development consistently fails to produce, because it requires treating some land as commons rather than commodity.

In London, the Citizens House project by London Community Land Trust placed affordable housing around a communal square — with staggered balconies designed so neighbors can see and talk to one another, and individual entrances opening onto shared public space rather than a double-loaded corridor. The design emerged directly from resident participation in the CLT governance process. When the community controls the land, the architecture serves gathering rather than privacy, connection rather than resale.

The pattern recurs: CLTs that steward land produce neighborhoods with more shared space, more housing variety, and more ground-floor community uses than equivalent market-rate developments — because the land is held for use, not speculation.

## Therefore

**In any neighborhood seeking permanent affordability, establish collective land stewardship — a Community Land Trust or equivalent — and use that stewardship to shape the physical neighborhood that market economics cannot produce: a mix of housing types (detached, attached, multi-unit) serving different incomes and life stages; shared spaces (courtyards, gardens, plazas) that no future owner can sell or pave; ground-floor community uses (workshops, meeting rooms, small commercial) that serve residents rather than maximizing rent. The trust holds the land. The pattern is what gets built on it — a neighborhood designed for permanence, not transaction.**

## Changes from current version

1. **Problem statement expanded** — added the physical consequence ("the physical fabric suffers too") alongside the economic one. The original only described affordability loss; the rewrite names the spatial loss: shared gardens, community workshops, housing diversity.

2. **Evidence rebuilt from verifiable sources:**
   - Champlain Housing Trust: updated from "over 700 homes" to accurate current figures (2,400+ rental, 600+ ownership, 115 co-ops) — verified via Wikipedia, RioOnWatch, and CHT's own site
   - Sawmill CLT (Albuquerque): 27-acre, 196 units of mixed types + civic spaces — verified via Lincoln Institute of Land Policy
   - London CLT Citizens House: communal square, staggered balconies, resident-driven design — verified via Dezeen and Azure Magazine

3. **"Therefore" completely rewritten** — from "establish a CLT" (organizational advice) to "use collective stewardship to shape the physical neighborhood" (spatial pattern). The CLT is the mechanism; the pattern is the *built result*.

4. **Confidence rating ★★ maintained** — now supported by three verified examples across two countries showing the spatial outcomes.

# 53. The Shared Boundary ★

**…within The Identifiable Neighborhood (41), Community Land Trust (50), Suburban Densification (29)…**

## Problem

**When the zone where one property meets another is designed by accident — drainage falling where gravity takes it, fences placed at the legal minimum, mechanical equipment shoved against the property line, windows staring into windows — every boundary becomes a source of conflict. The absence of deliberate design at the edge doesn't create freedom; it creates a permanent negotiation between neighbors who never agreed to the terms.**

## Evidence and Discussion

Most neighbor disputes are spatial before they are social. A study of residential complaint patterns in any municipal bylaw enforcement office reveals the same recurring list: water draining from one lot to another, fences blocking light or views, air conditioning compressors humming against a shared wall, security lights shining into bedrooms, trees dropping branches or shade across the line, decks and balconies overlooking private spaces.

These conflicts are not failures of communication — they are failures of design. The five-foot side setback in most residential zoning codes was established for fire separation, not for livability. It creates a ten-foot zone between buildings that belongs to no one and serves no one — too narrow for a garden, too exposed for storage, too neglected for maintenance. In many neighborhoods this gap becomes a dead zone of weeds, garbage bins, and resentment.

The design problem sharpens as density increases. When laneway houses, duplexes, and secondary suites are added to single-family lots — as they should be under The Missing Middle (12) — the boundary zone that was barely adequate for two detached houses becomes critically important for four or six dwelling units. Every additional unit multiplies the potential for drainage conflict, noise transmission, overlooking, and light trespass.

The solution is not a wider setback — that wastes land. It is a *designed boundary*: a zone where drainage is directed by intent, where fences serve both sides, where mechanical equipment is placed away from neighbors' quiet rooms, where windows are positioned to avoid direct sight lines, and where the edge of one property contributes to the quality of the next.

Traditional urbanism understood this. Row houses share party walls — a deliberate acoustic boundary designed once, serving both sides. European courtyard housing turns the boundary inward, creating shared gardens instead of dead side yards. Japanese residential design places windows high and small on boundary walls, preserving light while preventing overlooking. Each tradition solved the boundary problem through design rather than regulation.

## Therefore

**Design the boundary between adjacent properties as deliberately as you design the rooms inside them. Direct drainage away from the neighbor's foundation, not just away from your own. Place mechanical equipment (heat pumps, compressors, generators) on the side of the building farthest from the neighbor's bedrooms and living spaces. Position windows on boundary walls high or translucent — admitting light without sight lines. Build fences that serve both sides — finished on both faces, at a height that screens ground-level activity without blocking light above. When lots share a side yard, design it as a single usable space rather than two unusable strips. The test: stand at the property line and ask whether the design works for both sides, not just yours.**

## Changes from current version

1. **Renamed** from "The Neighborhood Agreement" to "The Shared Boundary" — the pattern is now spatial, not social.

2. **Problem statement completely rewritten** — from "no framework for negotiating shared concerns" (a social problem) to "the zone where one property meets another is designed by accident" (a design problem). Lists the specific spatial failures: drainage, fences, mechanical equipment, windows, light trespass.

3. **Evidence rebuilt around design failures, not communication failures:**
   - The five-foot side setback creates a dead zone designed for fire separation, not livability
   - Density intensification (Missing Middle) multiplies boundary conflicts
   - Traditional solutions from row houses (party walls), European courtyards (shared gardens), Japanese residential design (high windows on boundary walls)

4. **"Therefore" is now a spatial design instruction** — drainage direction, mechanical equipment placement, window positioning, fence design, shared side yards. Includes a testable criterion: "stand at the property line and ask whether the design works for both sides."

5. **Confidence rating ★ maintained** — appropriate since the evidence is drawn from design principles and traditional examples rather than measured outcomes.

6. **#88 Neighborhood Quiet Hours absorbed** — the noise dimension (mechanical equipment placement away from neighbors' bedrooms) is now part of this pattern's spatial solution, eliminating the need for #88 as a standalone.

7. **Connection to #89 The Buffer Landscape added** — the boundary zone and the buffer landscape are closely related at different scales.

# 60. Snow as Resource ★

**…within The Rain Garden (19), The Winter City Street (58)…**

## Problem

**Snow is treated as waste — plowed, salted, hauled to snow dumps at the edge of the city. But snow is water, insulation, and a shaper of landscape. In Edmonton, 123.5 centimeters of snow falls in an average year — the water equivalent of 111 millimeters of precipitation. When all of it is scraped away and dumped, the city loses a resource it spent the rest of the year buying back.**

## Evidence and Discussion

Fresh snow is roughly 90–95% trapped air by volume. Its density ranges from 50 to 200 kg/m³ depending on temperature and wind, with a typical fresh snowfall around 100 kg/m³ — meaning one cubic meter of fresh snow contains roughly 100 liters of water. That air content also makes snow a surprisingly effective insulator: fresh snow provides approximately R-1 per inch of depth (comparable to wood), enough that a 30-centimeter snowpack keeps the ground beneath it near freezing even when air temperatures drop to -30°C. Gardeners and farmers have known this for centuries — an early, deep snowfall protects root systems and prevents the deep frost heave that kills perennials.

The deliberate management of snow drift has been studied extensively. The Wyoming Department of Transportation, building on over 40 years of research by Dr. Ronald Tabler through the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP), found that trapping snow with fences costs roughly one hundred times less than mechanical removal. A properly designed snow fence — 50% porous, set back at a distance of 20 to 35 times its height from the area being protected — creates a controlled drift that deposits snow where it is wanted rather than where it causes problems. Iowa's Department of Transportation has operated a living snow fence program for over 40 years, using rows of native shrubs, grasses, and standing corn to trap blowing snow before it reaches highways. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service funds living snow fence programs through the Conservation Reserve Program across multiple northern states.

The principle translates directly to residential and neighborhood design. A snow fence or dense hedge on the north or west side of a garden creates a drift that insulates the soil beneath it and melts slowly in spring, delivering moisture to the garden over weeks rather than in a single runoff event. Roof snow directed to designated melt zones can feed rain gardens or cisterns — in Edmonton, a typical house roof (150 m²) collects roughly 15 cubic meters of snow in an average winter, equivalent to approximately 1,500 liters of meltwater. Designated snow storage areas in parking lots and parks, graded to drain toward rain gardens, capture the spring melt that would otherwise overwhelm storm drains.

The opposite of this pattern — the current norm — is instructive. In December 2025, Edmonton received 416% of its normal December precipitation as snow — 49 millimeters of water equivalent against a 30-year average of 11.8 millimeters, with 43 to 67 centimeters of snow recorded across the city. The city's removal-based approach collapsed under the volume. Crews worked non-stop for over 20 days. The city warned that residential roads would take two to three more weeks to clear. Residential streets remained impassable into February. The snow that was removed sat contaminated with road salt in four municipal storage sites, eventually melting into waterways rather than soaking into soil. Meanwhile, Alberta farmers noted that the same snowfall could help replenish water tables and refill dugouts that had been declining through years of drought — the snow was exactly the moisture the region needed, delivered to precisely the wrong place by a system designed to treat it as waste.

This is the paradigm: cities spend enormous sums removing snow, spread salt that damages soil, vegetation, and concrete, haul the contaminated result to remote dumps, and deprive urban trees and gardens of the insulating blanket and spring moisture that snow naturally provides. The December 2025 event did not reveal a failure of capacity. It revealed a failure of design.

## Therefore

**Design the landscape and building to use snow rather than remove it. Place living snow fences — dense rows of shrubs or native grasses — on the windward side of gardens and outdoor spaces to create controlled drifts that insulate soil and deliver slow meltwater in spring. Direct roof snow to designated melt zones graded to feed rain gardens or storage cisterns. In parking lots and common areas, grade snow storage zones so spring melt flows to planted infiltration areas rather than storm drains. Preserve the snowpack on garden beds and around trees — do not plow or salt where the snow is doing useful work. The test: in April, is your meltwater feeding your garden or flooding your storm drain?**

## Changes from current version

1. **Problem statement rewritten** — removed the garbled "a ton of fresh snow contains roughly 100 liters of water" (confusingly stated and failed verification). Replaced with Edmonton-specific annual snowfall data (123.5 cm, 111 mm water equivalent) from Environment Canada, framing the loss as an economic and ecological absurdity.

2. **Evidence completely rebuilt with verifiable sources:**
   - Snow density: 50–200 kg/m³, typically ~100 kg/m³ for fresh snow (standard avalanche/meteorological science, confirmed by NASA, USGS, multiple sources)
   - Snow R-value: ~R-1 per inch (confirmed by building science literature — GreenBuildingAdvisor, JLC, HVAC industry sources)
   - Wyoming DOT / SHRP: Dr. Ronald Tabler's 40+ years of snow fence research; mechanical removal costs ~100x more than fencing (SHRP report SHRP-W/FR-91-106)
   - Iowa DOT living snow fence program: 40+ years, standing corn and native plantings (Iowa Highway Research Board Project TR 460)
   - USDA NRCS Conservation Reserve Program: funds living snow fences across northern states
   - Edmonton climate: 123.5 cm annual snowfall, 111 mm water equivalent, snow on ground 133 days/year (Environment Canada 1981–2010 normals via Wikipedia Climate of Edmonton)

3. **Removed unverifiable claims:**
   - "Nordic design traditions use snow deliberately" — too vague, no specific program or tradition cited
   - "Japanese snow country architecture uses steep roofs to direct snow into designated melt zones" — while Japanese snow country architecture is real (Kawabata wrote a novel about it), the specific claim about "designated melt zones" was not verifiable as a design tradition
   - Both replaced with the extensively documented Wyoming DOT and Iowa DOT snow fence programs

4. **Added December 2025 Edmonton case study:**
   - 416% of normal December precipitation (Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologist Terri Lang, via CBC News December 30, 2025)
   - 49.1 mm water equivalent vs. 11.8 mm 30-year average (same source)
   - 43–67 cm snow recorded by Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network volunteers (same source)
   - Crews working non-stop 20+ days, 2–3 more weeks estimated for residential clearing (City of Edmonton general supervisor Valerie Dacyk, via CBC News)
   - Residential streets still impassable into February 2026 (Andrew's direct observation)
   - Farmer noting snow would replenish declining water tables and dugouts (Raymond Chittick, Mayerthorpe-area farmer, via CBC News January 2, 2026)
   - Sources: CBC News December 30, 2025 (edmonton-snow-clearing-december) and CBC News January 2, 2026 (alberta-december-snow)

5. **Added specific residential design moves:**
   - Roof snow calculation for a typical Edmonton house (150 m² roof × 123.5 cm snow ÷ 10 density ratio ≈ 1,500 liters meltwater)
   - Living snow fence placement principle (windward side of gardens)
   - Parking lot snow storage grading toward rain gardens
   - Explicit instruction to *not* plow or salt where snow is insulating

6. **Added testable criterion:** "In April, is your meltwater feeding your garden or flooding your storm drain?"

7. **Confidence remains at ★** — the principle is sound and the supporting research (snow fences, snow insulation) is well-documented, but the residential-scale application — designing home landscapes to *use* snow rather than remove it — has less documented precedent. The pattern is still somewhat speculative at the household design scale. Honest to keep it at ★ until more built examples exist.

# 80. The Care Suite ★★

**…within The Lifetime Home (15), The Multigenerational Suite (14), A Room of One's Own (original 141)…**

## Problem

**When a family member needs daily care — after surgery, during illness, in advanced age — the options are institutional care that costs over $110,000 per year, or home care in a building not designed for it, where 14 million older adults fall annually and one in four of those falls causes injury. A room designed for care is neither a hospital room nor a regular bedroom — it has specific spatial needs that neither provides.**

## Evidence and Discussion

Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for adults 65 and older in the United States. The CDC reports that one in four older adults — roughly 14 million people — falls each year, resulting in approximately 3 million emergency department visits and over 38,000 deaths annually. The death rate from falls increased 41% between 2012 and 2021. The projected cost of fall-related injuries will reach $101 billion by 2030. Most falls happen at home, and most are preventable with environmental modifications: grab bars, adequate doorway widths, level thresholds, non-slip flooring.

The economics of care make the design case. A semi-private nursing home room costs $9,277 per month nationally — $111,324 per year (Genworth 2024 Cost of Care Survey). A private room exceeds $127,000. Assisted living averages $70,800 per year. These costs are projected to reach $186,000 annually by 2030. By comparison, comprehensive home accessibility modifications — wider doorways, roll-in shower, grab bars, threshold removal — cost $12,000 to $16,000 for a one-story home, with the national average around $9,500. Even adding part-time home care support, a five-year comparison shows aging in place at roughly $55,000 total versus $321,000 for assisted living versus $520,000 or more for nursing home care.

The preference data is overwhelming. AARP surveys consistently find that 77% of Americans over 50 want to remain in their current homes as they age. More recent data puts the figure at 94–95% of seniors preferring to age in place over institutional care. Yet most homes cannot accommodate it: doorways too narrow for wheelchairs, bathrooms without grab bars or roll-in access, bedrooms reachable only by stairs.

The ADA Standards for Accessible Design specify what the care room requires. Doorways need 36 inches of clear width for wheelchair passage. Roll-in showers need a minimum of 60 by 30 inches of clear interior space, with a threshold no higher than half an inch. Grab bars must withstand 250 pounds of force and be mounted 33 to 36 inches above the finished floor. A transfer space of 36 by 48 inches must be clear beside the shower and beside the bed. These are not generous allowances — they are the minimum dimensions for a person in a wheelchair to turn, transfer, and be assisted safely.

What gets less attention is the caregiver. Family caregivers — the 53 million Americans providing unpaid care — show a median depression prevalence of 33%, anxiety prevalence of 35%, and burden prevalence of 49% (2025 meta-analysis). The average caregiver provides 22 to 26 hours of care per week; 19% provide more than 41 hours. The CDC found that caregivers had worse outcomes for 13 of 19 health indicators examined. Sixty percent report moderate to high emotional stress. The spatial design of the care environment directly affects caregiver strain: a room where the caregiver can sit comfortably overnight, where the bathroom is adjacent (not down a hall), where the doorway admits a hospital bed without scraping the frame — these are not amenities. They are the difference between sustainable care and burnout.

The pattern asks for a room that is *convertible*, not *dedicated*. Most of its life, it is a guest room, a study, a quiet room. But it is designed so that when care is needed — and statistically, it will be — the conversion requires no construction: the doorway is already 36 inches, the bathroom already has blocking for grab bars, the shower already has a flush threshold, and the path from bed to bathroom is already clear and level.

## Therefore

**…provide one room that can convert to a care suite without renovation — a room with a 36-inch doorway, an adjacent bathroom with a roll-in shower (60 × 30 inches minimum, flush threshold), grab bar blocking in the walls, a clear path wide enough for a hospital bed, good natural light, ventilation, and an intercom or monitoring connection to the main living area. Include a comfortable seat for an overnight caregiver. The room should be on the entry level, reachable without stairs. It should be comfortable and dignified, not clinical — it is still a room in a home, not a ward in a hospital. The test: could a family member recovering from hip surgery live in this room for six weeks without anyone picking up a hammer?**

## Changes from current version

1. **Problem statement rewritten** — added the two anchoring statistics (14 million falls/year, $110,000+/year institutional care) that frame the tension between dangerous home care and expensive institutional care.

2. **Evidence completely rebuilt with verifiable sources:**
   - CDC falls data: 14 million falls/year, 1 in 4 adults 65+, 3 million ED visits, 38,000 deaths, 41% increase in death rate 2012–2021, $101 billion projected cost by 2030 (CDC WISQARS, BRFSS, National Vital Statistics System)
   - Cost comparisons: Genworth 2024 Cost of Care Survey — nursing home semi-private $9,277/month, private $10,646/month, assisted living $5,900/month
   - Home modification costs: $9,500 national average, $12,000–$16,000 comprehensive one-story (HomeAdvisor, AARP aging-in-place guides)
   - Aging-in-place preferences: 77% of Americans 50+ want to stay home (AARP), 94–95% of seniors prefer home to institutional care
   - ADA specifications: 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design — 36" doorway, 60"×30" roll-in shower, ½" max threshold, grab bars at 33–36" height rated for 250 lbs, 36"×48" transfer space
   - Caregiver burnout: 33% depression prevalence, 35% anxiety, 49% burden (2025 meta-analysis); 22–26 hours/week average care; 19% provide 41+ hours; worse outcomes on 13 of 19 health indicators (CDC 2021–2022); 60% moderate-to-high emotional stress (NAC/AARP)

3. **Previous evidence section was not an evidence section** — the old text simply described the spatial solution (wider doorway, shower seat, intercom) without citing any data. The solution was sound; the evidence was absent. Now the evidence section establishes *why* the solution matters using falls epidemiology, cost analysis, preference data, ADA standards, and caregiver health.

4. **Added caregiver dimension** — the old version mentioned "space for a caregiver to sit comfortably overnight" but didn't explain why. Now the evidence establishes that caregiver burnout is a measurable health crisis (33% depression, 49% burden) and that the spatial design of the care environment directly affects sustainability of home care.

5. **Added testable criterion:** "Could a family member recovering from hip surgery live in this room for six weeks without anyone picking up a hammer?"

6. **Confidence remains at ★★** — now properly supported. The falls data is ironclad (CDC), the cost comparisons are from the industry standard survey (Genworth), the ADA specifications are federal standards, and the caregiver burnout data is from peer-reviewed meta-analysis. This pattern has stronger evidence backing than most ★★ patterns in the collection.

# 88. The Acoustic Buffer ★★

**…within The Shared Boundary (53), Dark Sky Neighborhood (3), The Identifiable Neighborhood (41)…**

## Problem

**When nothing stands between a noise source and a quiet space — no mass, no distance, no planting, no topography — sound travels unobstructed and the outdoor life of the neighborhood is destroyed. People retreat indoors, close their windows, and lose the gardens, porches, and courtyards that make a neighborhood livable.**

## Evidence and Discussion

The WHO Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region (2018) recommend outdoor noise levels below 55 dB(A) during the day and below 40 dB(A) outside bedrooms at night to prevent adverse health effects. The EPA identifies the same thresholds — 55 dB outdoors, 45 dB indoors — as the levels below which normal conversation, sleep, and outdoor activity can proceed without interference. In the EU, roughly 40% of the population is exposed to road traffic noise exceeding 55 dB(A) during the day, and over 30% to levels exceeding 55 dB(A) at night.

The problem is not the existence of noise — a living neighborhood makes sound. Children play, dogs bark, cars arrive, neighbors talk on porches. The problem is the absence of anything between those sounds and the spaces that need quiet. Sound attenuates with distance and is blocked, absorbed, or scattered by mass. When neighborhoods are designed without acoustic buffers — when the bedroom window faces the arterial road with nothing between them but air — the only options are sealed windows and mechanical ventilation, or chronic noise exposure.

The tools are well understood. The USDA National Agroforestry Center and the Federal Highway Administration have quantified the acoustic performance of landscape buffers: a 100-foot planted buffer reduces noise by 5–8 dB(A); the same buffer with an earth berm achieves 10–15 dB(A) reduction. A solid masonry or concrete wall can reduce noise by up to 15 dB(A) when positioned close to the source. Dense plantings of mixed broadleaf and evergreen species reduce noise by roughly 10 dB over a 25–50 foot depth — and 10 dB is perceived as halving the loudness.

But acoustic performance is not the only criterion. A highway sound wall blocks noise effectively and creates a dead, hostile edge. An earth berm planted with trees blocks nearly as much noise and creates a park. The pattern is about achieving acoustic separation through design moves that also create good spaces — berms that become hillside gardens, dense plantings that become wildlife corridors, masonry walls that become the back of a courtyard.

The critical principle: the buffer must block the *line of sight* between the noise source and the receiver. If you can see the source, the buffer is insufficient. This is both an acoustic rule (direct sound propagation follows line of sight) and a psychological one (visible noise sources are perceived as louder than hidden ones, even at the same decibel level).

## Therefore

**Between every significant noise source and the spaces that need quiet — between the arterial road and the bedroom, between the mechanical equipment and the garden, between the loading dock and the courtyard — place a physical buffer with enough mass and height to break the line of sight. Use earth berms (minimum 1.2 meters high, planted with dense evergreen and broadleaf species) where space permits. Use masonry walls where it does not. Shape the buffer so it creates a usable space on the quiet side — a sheltered garden behind a berm, a courtyard behind a wall, a woodland walk through a planted strip. The test: stand in the quiet space and look toward the noise source. If you can see it, the buffer is not working.**

## Changes from current version (#88 Neighborhood Quiet Hours)

1. **Completely replaced** — "Neighborhood Quiet Hours" was a social agreement pattern (designate quiet hours, post them on signs, enforce through social pressure). Not spatial. Not buildable. Deleted entirely.

2. **New pattern is fully spatial** — the problem is the absence of physical mass between noise and quiet. The solution is earth, stone, and plants, not rules and signs.

3. **Evidence is verifiable:**
   - WHO Environmental Noise Guidelines for European Region (2018): outdoor < 55 dB(A) day, < 40 dB(A) night outside bedrooms
   - EPA threshold: 55 dB outdoor, 45 dB indoor
   - EU exposure: ~40% of population exposed to road traffic noise > 55 dB(A)
   - USDA/FHWA: 100-foot planted buffer = 5–8 dB(A) reduction; with berm = 10–15 dB(A)
   - Dense mixed plantings: ~10 dB over 25–50 foot depth
   - Solid wall: up to 15 dB(A) close to source

4. **Confidence upgraded from ★ to ★★** — the evidence base for acoustic buffers is extensive, well-documented by federal agencies (FHWA, USDA, EPA), and the WHO guidelines provide clear performance targets.

5. **Key design insight:** buffer must create *good space* on the quiet side, not just block sound. Berms become gardens. Walls become courtyards. Planted strips become woodland walks. Alexander would insist on this — the solution must be alive, not merely functional.

6. **Testable criterion:** "stand in the quiet space and look toward the noise source. If you can see it, the buffer is not working." Both acoustically accurate (line-of-sight = direct sound path) and practically testable on site.

7. **Absorbs the useful intent of #88** — the old pattern wanted neighborhood quiet. This pattern achieves it through physical design rather than social agreement.
