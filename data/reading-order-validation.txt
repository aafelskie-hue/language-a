## Boundary Assessment

### Neighborhood -> Building Transition
- Last 3 neighborhood patterns: 220, 224, 256
- First 3 building patterns: 38, 15, 144
- Direct connections: 0

### Building -> Construction Transition
- Last 3 building patterns: 30, 26, 7
- First 3 construction patterns: 56, 54, 216
- Direct connections: 1

## Decision Log
- Sorting algorithm: context_score descending with cluster affinity
- Context score = (up references) - (down references) within same scale
- Cluster affinity: swapped adjacent patterns if same category and score difference <= 2
- Scale order: all neighborhood, then all building, then all construction
