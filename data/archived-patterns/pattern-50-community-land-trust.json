  "problem": "When land and buildings are sold together as a single commodity, housing prices are driven by land speculation rather than the cost of shelter, neighborhoods change faster than communities can adapt, and the people who built a place are the first to be displaced from it.",
  "body": "The fundamental problem is well understood. Housing markets conflate two very different things: the value of a building — which depreciates over time and reflects the labor and materials that went into it — and the value of land, which appreciates as communities invest in schools, parks, transit, and social infrastructure. A family buys a house. The neighborhood improves. Land values rise. Taxes follow. The family can no longer afford to stay. The improvements they helped create benefit someone else.\n\nThis is not a minor distortion. In many North American cities, land accounts for 50–80% of residential property value. A household is not really buying a home — it is buying a speculative position in a land market. When that market rises, existing residents are priced out. When it falls, they are underwater. Either way, the house — the actual shelter — is hostage to forces that have nothing to do with its quality or the needs of its occupants.\n\nThe community land trust separates these two values. The CLT — a nonprofit governed by residents, community members, and public representatives in equal thirds — owns the land permanently. Individuals own or rent the buildings on that land. When a homeowner sells, a resale formula ensures the home remains affordable to the next buyer, typically allowing the seller to recover their investment and a modest share of any appreciation, while the community retains the rest. The land never re-enters the speculative market.\n\nThis is not a new idea. The first modern CLT in the United States was established in Albany, Georgia, in 1969, emerging from the civil rights movement as a way for Black farmers to access land they had been systematically denied. Today there are over 300 CLTs across the United States holding more than 40,000 housing units. The Burlington Community Land Trust in Vermont, founded in 1984, has grown to over 700 units and demonstrated that CLT homeowners experience dramatically lower rates of mortgage delinquency and foreclosure than conventional buyers — the land trust provides stability precisely because it removes the speculative variable.\n\nThe spatial implications are specific. A CLT neighborhood looks different from a conventional development because it can afford to look different. When land cost is removed from the equation, buildings can be smaller, gardens larger, shared spaces more generous. The Missing Middle housing types — duplexes, triplexes, cottage courts — become economically viable without developer subsidies because the land beneath them is not priced for maximum extraction. The architecture can respond to human needs rather than to the pressure to maximize floor area ratio.\n\nThe governance structure matters as much as the financial structure. Ostrom's research on commons management — for which she received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009 — identified eight design principles for successful collective resource governance: clear boundaries, rules adapted to local conditions, participatory decision-making, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution, recognized self-governance, and nested institutions. CLTs that follow these principles endure. Those that neglect them — particularly participatory decision-making and clear boundaries — fail like any other commons.\n\nThe 99-year ground lease is the mechanism that makes permanence possible. It is long enough to provide security of tenure for any human lifetime, and its terms ensure that the land remains under community stewardship across generations. This is not public housing — residents own their homes, maintain them, improve them, and build equity in them. What they cannot do is extract speculative profit from the land beneath.",
  "solution": "Where housing affordability is threatened by land speculation, establish a community land trust to hold residential land permanently outside the speculative market. Govern it with a tripartite board — one-third residents, one-third community members, one-third public interest representatives. Lease land to homeowners and renters through long-term ground leases with resale formulas that preserve affordability across generations. Use the CLT structure to enable Missing Middle housing types — duplexes, cottage courts, small apartment buildings — that would otherwise be uneconomical. The test of success is not how many units are built, but whether a teacher, a carpenter, and a shop clerk can still afford to live in the neighborhood their labor helps sustain, twenty years from now.",
