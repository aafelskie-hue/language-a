# Category X: Patterns for Construction and Making — Category Plan

## For Claude Code / Pattern Generator

This document maps 8 new patterns for Category X, expanding it from 4 patterns (54–57) to 12. These fill the construction-scale gap where Language A currently thins out. The existing four patterns establish the philosophy — repair, self-reliance, honest materials, shared workshop. The eight new patterns give that philosophy architectural and constructional specificity.

## Existing Category X Patterns (Live)

| ID | Name | Confidence | Role |
|----|------|-----------|------|
| 54 | Repair Culture | ★ | The ethos — build to fix, not to replace |
| 55 | The Owner-Builder | ★ | The agency — the occupant as builder |
| 56 | Honest Materials | ★★ | The principle — materials that show what they are |
| 57 | The Community Workshop | ★ | The shared infrastructure — tools and skills in common |

## 8 New Patterns — Sequenced from Structure to Maintenance

The sequence follows Alexander's construction-scale logic: how the building is **layered** → what it's **made of** → how parts **meet** → how humans **mark** it → how it's **cared for**. Each pattern is numbered provisionally — final IDs assigned during integration.

### Pattern X-1: The Permanent Frame, The Changeable Skin ★★

**Scale:** Construction (with building-scale implications)

**Core tension:** When all building layers share the same lifespan and are entangled in construction, you must demolish to renovate. A kitchen remodel shouldn't require opening walls. A re-roofing shouldn't require removing insulation. A window replacement shouldn't require reframing.

**Evidence direction:**
- Stewart Brand's "How Buildings Learn" (1994) — the concept of shearing layers: site (eternal), structure (30–300 years), skin (20+ years), services (7–15 years), space plan (3–30 years), stuff (daily). The key insight is that layers with different lifespans should be physically separable.
- Japanese temple construction — the Ise Grand Shrine is rebuilt every 20 years using the same techniques, demonstrating the principle of a permanent design with replaceable material.
- Modern parallels: open building / support-infill (John Habraken, NL), where the load-bearing structure is separated from the fit-out so individual units can be reconfigured without affecting neighbors.
- Passive house detailing often entangles insulation, air barrier, and structure — creating high-performance envelopes that are extremely difficult to modify. This is the tension with Building Envelope as Climate System (#21 in current catalog).

**Therefore direction:** Separate the long-life structure (100+ years: foundation, frame, load-bearing walls) from the medium-life envelope (30–50 years: cladding, windows, roofing) from the short-life fit-out (10–15 years: kitchens, bathrooms, finishes, services). Design the connections between these layers so each can be replaced without disturbing the others. The structure should outlast everything attached to it. The skin should be removable without cracking the bones. The services should be accessible without opening the skin.

**Connections:**
- Up: Building Envelope as Climate System, Deep Walls (46), various building-scale patterns
- Down: Honest Joinery (X-5), Visible Structure (X-2), Repair Culture (54)
- Lateral: The Owner-Builder (55) — separable layers make owner modification possible

**Confidence rationale:** ★★ — Brand's framework is well-established, the Habraken open building tradition has 50+ years of built precedent, and the principle is measurably beneficial (lifecycle cost reduction, adaptability, reduced demolition waste).

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Stewart Brand "How Buildings Learn" shearing layers framework (1994)
- Ise Grand Shrine 20-year rebuild cycle
- John Habraken and the Open Building / SAR methodology
- Specific lifecycle estimates (100 years structure, 30-50 skin, 10-15 fit-out)

### Pattern X-2: Visible Structure ★★

**Scale:** Construction

**Core tension:** When the structure of a building is hidden behind drywall and dropped ceilings, inhabitants lose the intuitive understanding of how their building works. They don't know where they can hang a heavy shelf, where a wall is load-bearing, or why the building feels solid in one room and flimsy in another. The building becomes opaque to the people who live in it.

**Evidence direction:**
- Alexander's own Structure Follows Social Spaces (205 in the original) — the argument that structure should be legible. Language A doesn't reference Alexander directly, but the principle stands independently.
- Exposed timber frame construction in Japanese residential architecture — the visible post-and-beam creates a room whose structural logic is immediately comprehensible.
- Industrial loft conversions — the exposed brick, steel columns, and timber beams are the primary aesthetic appeal. People pay a premium for visible structure because it communicates honesty and durability.
- The movement toward mass timber (CLT, glulam) in contemporary architecture — these materials are designed to be left exposed, serving as both structure and finish simultaneously.
- Cognitive science: legible environments reduce anxiety. When people understand the structural logic of a space, they feel safer and more settled. This connects to Christopher Day's "Places of the Soul."

**Therefore direction:** Expose the structural system of the building wherever possible — the beam, the column, the load path from roof to foundation. In timber construction, leave posts and beams unclad. In masonry, leave bearing walls exposed. In concrete, express the formwork. Where structure must be enclosed (for fire rating, insulation, or services), make the enclosure legible — a thickened wall at a column, a lowered ceiling at a beam — so the structural logic is felt even when it's not seen. The inhabitant should be able to point to any wall and know whether it holds up the roof.

**Connections:**
- Up: The Permanent Frame (X-1), Deep Walls (46), Honest Materials (56)
- Down: Honest Joinery (X-5), The Hand-Made Detail (X-6)
- Lateral: Building Envelope as Climate System — tension between sealed envelopes and exposed structure

**Confidence rationale:** ★★ — visible structure is the defining characteristic of nearly all pre-industrial architecture. The mass timber movement is providing modern precedent. The cognitive benefits of legible environments are well-documented.

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Mass timber (CLT/glulam) as exposed structure trend and building code acceptance
- Loft conversion aesthetic premium (any market data on price premiums for exposed structure)
- Christopher Day "Places of the Soul" reference
- Fire rating requirements for exposed structural timber (regional variation)

---

### Pattern X-3: Local Material Radius ★

**Scale:** Construction (with neighborhood-scale implications)

**Core tension:** When building materials are sourced globally — granite from China, lumber from Brazil, tile from Italy, steel from wherever it's cheapest — every building looks like every other building, the local material economy atrophies, transportation emissions dwarf manufacturing emissions, and the building has no relationship to the land it sits on. The materials available nearby are the materials your region's buildings have always been made from. They look right because they come from the same geology.

**Evidence direction:**
- Vernacular architecture — the reason Cotswold buildings look like Cotswold and New England buildings look like New England is local material: limestone there, granite and timber here. The character comes from constraint.
- Edmonton/Prairie specifics: the local material palette includes dimensional softwood lumber (spruce-pine-fir from Alberta mills), concrete (Alberta limestone aggregate), clay brick (limited local production, mostly historical), and rammed earth or compressed earth block (suitable soils exist in the region).
- Embodied carbon: transportation accounts for 10-15% of embodied carbon in conventional construction. Reducing transport distance has measurable carbon benefits, especially for heavy materials (concrete, masonry, stone).
- Local stone programs: several regions have revived local quarrying. The Scottish Stone Liaison Group, for example, matches restoration projects with local quarries.
- The 150km radius is a pragmatic threshold — roughly the distance a truck can deliver in a half-day round trip, making daily delivery economically viable.

**Therefore direction:** Source the heaviest, most voluminous building materials — structure, cladding, aggregate, masonry — from within 150 kilometers where possible. This is not environmental virtue signaling; it is a design constraint that produces better buildings. The materials available nearby are the materials the local building tradition evolved to use. They weather correctly in the local climate. They match existing buildings without trying. They support local industry. Reserve global sourcing for lightweight, high-value components where local alternatives don't exist (hardware, glazing units, specialized finishes).

**Connections:**
- Up: Honest Materials (56), site-scale patterns, Neighborhood Energy Commons (if applicable)
- Down: Materials That Age (X-4), Honest Joinery (X-5)
- Lateral: Building Envelope as Climate System — local materials must meet performance targets

**Confidence rationale:** ★ — the principle is ancient and intuitive, but the 150km radius is somewhat arbitrary. Actual viable radii depend on material type, regional industry, and infrastructure. Strong directionally but specific thresholds need local calibration.

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Transportation as 10-15% of embodied carbon in conventional construction
- Edmonton-area material availability (SPF lumber mills, concrete plants, brick producers)
- Scottish Stone Liaison Group program
- 150km delivery economics (half-day round trip viability)

### Pattern X-4: Materials That Age ★★

**Scale:** Construction

**Core tension:** Some materials get better with time — wood darkens and gains character, copper develops a verde patina, stone weathers to reveal its grain, brick mellows, concrete grows lichen. Other materials get worse — vinyl yellows and cracks, composite decking splinters, foam insulation degrades, painted MDF swells and peels. The first group rewards care with beauty. The second group punishes time with ugliness. When a building is clad entirely in the second group, it has a decade of looking new followed by decades of looking shabby. When it's clad in the first, its oldest day is its most beautiful.

**Evidence direction:**
- The Japanese concept of wabi-sabi — beauty in imperfection and transience. Not as aesthetic philosophy but as material specification: choose materials whose aged state is their most valued state.
- Specific material aging profiles: copper (300+ year lifespan, patina develops within 7-10 years), western red cedar (50+ year cladding life, silvers gracefully), zinc (100+ years, develops grey-blue patina), Corten steel (weathers to stable rust layer, used structurally), limestone (millennia, sharpens in profile as rain carves detail), clay brick (centuries, mellows in color).
- Contrasting: vinyl siding (15-30 year lifespan, becomes brittle, color fades irreversibly), EIFS (synthetic stucco — susceptible to moisture damage, delaminates), composite decking (10-25 years, splinters, fades, cannot be refinished).
- This is distinct from Honest Materials (#56) — honest materials show what they are. Materials That Age show *when* they are. A new copper roof is honest but hasn't aged. An old copper roof is both honest and beautiful in its age.
- Insurance and lifecycle cost data: buildings clad in durable aging materials have lower maintenance costs over 50-year horizons despite higher initial costs.

**Therefore direction:** For every exterior surface and every surface you touch — cladding, flooring, countertops, handrails, door hardware — choose materials whose oldest surviving examples are more beautiful than their newest. Wood over vinyl. Stone over composite. Copper over painted steel. Clay over concrete block. Where cost requires compromise, use aging materials where they're touched and seen (entries, handrails, window sills, thresholds) and accept lesser materials only where they're hidden or protected. The test: photograph the material at 1 year and at 50 years. If 50 years looks better, use it.

**Connections:**
- Up: Honest Materials (56), Local Material Radius (X-3), Living Surfaces (47)
- Down: Honest Joinery (X-5), The Hand-Made Detail (X-6), Seasonal Maintenance Ritual (X-8)
- Lateral: Heritage Retrofit (29 in current catalog) — aged materials in existing buildings

**Confidence rationale:** ★★ — the material science is well-established. Lifecycle cost data supports the thesis. The principle is as old as building itself — the Parthenon's marble is more beautiful at 2,500 years than it was at 5.

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Copper patina development timeline (7-10 years)
- Specific material lifespan ranges (copper 300+, cedar 50+, zinc 100+, etc.)
- Vinyl siding lifespan and degradation profile
- EIFS moisture damage susceptibility
- Lifecycle cost comparison data (high-durability vs. low-durability cladding over 50 years)

### Pattern X-5: Honest Joinery ★★

**Scale:** Construction (detail scale)

**Core tension:** When the connections between materials are concealed — caulked, taped, covered with trim, hidden behind reveals — the building becomes a sealed box that can neither be understood nor repaired. Where wood meets stone, where wall meets floor, where roof meets wall — if the joint doesn't show how the building is assembled, the building can't teach its inhabitants how to maintain it. Concealed connections create dependency on specialists. Revealed connections create self-reliance.

**Evidence direction:**
- Traditional Japanese joinery — hundreds of interlocking wood joints that hold without fasteners, each one legible and beautiful. The joint is the ornament.
- Timber frame construction (Western tradition) — mortise and tenon, pegged connections, scarf joints. The connections are visible, repairable, and add character. Contrast with modern platform framing where every connection is buried in sheathing and drywall.
- Masonry: corbelling, soldier courses, header patterns — the structure of the wall is visible in the bond pattern. Contrast with veneered construction where the brick is a decorative skin with no structural logic.
- The Arts and Crafts movement (Morris, Greene & Greene) — honest expression of construction as an ethical and aesthetic position.
- Practical benefit: when joints are visible, failure is visible. A separating mortise-and-tenon joint can be seen and repaired. A delaminating glued connection behind drywall becomes a structural problem before anyone notices.
- Modern examples: exposed steel connections (bolted, not welded and ground smooth), expressed CLT panel joints, visible timber connectors.

**Therefore direction:** At every junction where two materials meet — wall to floor, wall to roof, wood to stone, old to new — make the joint express how the building is assembled. Use mechanical fasteners (screws, bolts, pegs) over adhesives. Leave connection plates visible rather than concealing them in wall cavities. Where trim covers a joint, let the trim express the joint rather than hiding it — a cover board that shows it's bridging two surfaces, not a seamless caulk line pretending the joint doesn't exist. The test: can the building's owner point to any junction and explain how the two parts connect? If not, the joinery is dishonest.

**Connections:**
- Up: Honest Materials (56), Visible Structure (X-2), The Permanent Frame (X-1)
- Down: The Hand-Made Detail (X-6) — joinery is where the hand is most present
- Lateral: Repair Culture (54) — honest joints are repairable joints; The Owner-Builder (55) — legible joints enable owner maintenance

**Confidence rationale:** ★★ — the principle has been demonstrated continuously for thousands of years across every building culture. The practical benefits (inspectability, repairability, comprehensibility) are self-evident. The aesthetic benefits are evidenced by the premium paid for exposed-connection construction.

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Japanese joinery tradition (number of joint types — "hundreds" may be overstated or understated)
- Greene & Greene / Arts and Crafts movement connection to honest construction
- CLT panel joint expression in contemporary practice
- Any data on repair cost differential between concealed vs. exposed connections

### Pattern X-6: The Hand-Made Detail ★

**Scale:** Construction (finest detail scale)

**Core tension:** In an age of CNC precision, laser-cut profiles, and factory prefabrication, every building detail can be perfectly identical, perfectly smooth, perfectly repeatable — and perfectly empty. The precision is impressive but the absence of the human hand is felt, even when it can't be named. A building with no hand-made elements feels manufactured, not built. Not nostalgic for imperfection — but recognizing that the mark of a human hand is evidence that a person was here, that someone cared enough to do this particular thing in this particular place.

**Evidence direction:**
- The neurological basis: humans are neurologically wired to detect and respond to evidence of other human agency. We read the toolmarks on a hand-carved bracket the way we read a handwritten letter — as evidence of a specific person's attention. Research in neuroaesthetics (Semir Zeki, UCL) suggests the brain processes handmade irregularity differently from machine regularity.
- The hand-made detail as economic marker: in pre-industrial construction, everything was hand-made. In industrial construction, nothing is. Post-industrial construction can choose — and the choice to include hand-made elements is a deliberate act of investment in the building's character.
- Precedent: the Sagrada Familia's hand-carved stonework; Gaudi's trencadís mosaic. Indian stepwell carving. Islamic geometric tile work. The Alhambra's stucco. In every case, the hand-made detail is what visitors cross continents to see.
- Contemporary practice: hand-thrown tile (Heath Ceramics, Fireclay), hand-forged hardware (blacksmith-made hinges, handles), hand-laid mosaic, hand-carved stone, hand-adzed timber. These are not anachronisms — they're the elements that give a building a soul.
- The minimum viable hand: one element is enough. A single hand-forged door handle. A hand-laid tile backsplash. A carved house number. The building doesn't need to be entirely hand-made. It needs evidence that a hand was present.

**Therefore direction:** In every building, include at least one element made by a human hand rather than a machine — a carved bracket, a hand-laid mosaic, a forged hinge, a hand-thrown tile, a hand-adzed beam. Place it where inhabitants touch it daily: the front door handle, the stair newel, the kitchen backsplash, the fireplace surround. The hand-made element need not be large or expensive — a single hand-forged handle costs less than a factory-made designer handle — but it must be placed where it's encountered, not displayed. The test: close your eyes and run your hand along it. Can you feel that a person made this?

**Connections:**
- Up: Honest Joinery (X-5), Honest Materials (56), Visible Structure (X-2)
- Down: (terminal — this is the finest scale in the category)
- Lateral: The Owner-Builder (55) — the hand-made detail can be the owner's own work

**Confidence rationale:** ★ — the argument is compelling and the precedent is universal, but the evidence base is more aesthetic and philosophical than empirical. The neuroaesthetics research exists but is early-stage. Moderate confidence is honest.

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Semir Zeki neuroaesthetics research (UCL) — does it specifically address handmade vs. machine-made perception?
- Heath Ceramics / Fireclay as contemporary hand-thrown tile producers
- Cost comparison: hand-forged hardware vs. designer factory hardware
- Sagrada Familia hand-carved stonework (ongoing construction details)

### Pattern X-7: The Tool Wall ★

**Scale:** Construction (building interior detail)

**Core tension:** When repair tools are stored in a closed garage cabinet, a basement box, or a junk drawer, they're out of sight and out of mind. Small repairs get deferred because finding the right tool requires an expedition. The screwdriver is buried under holiday decorations. The wrench is in a plastic bin behind the snow tires. The building's maintenance depends on tools being available, and availability depends on visibility. A tool you can see is a tool you'll use.

**Evidence direction:**
- Workshop organization (the original): any craftsperson's workshop has tools on walls, organized by function, silhouetted for quick identification. This isn't just efficiency — it's a relationship with the tools. You see what you have, you notice what's missing, you reach for what you need.
- The domestic translation: kitchen tools have this already — knives on magnetic strips, pots on hooks, utensils in crocks. Nobody stores kitchen knives in a box in the basement. The same principle applies to building maintenance tools.
- Marie Kondo's organizational principle inverted: KonMari hides everything for visual calm. The tool wall reveals everything for functional readiness. Both are correct in their domain — you hide what you consume (clothes, goods) but reveal what you use (tools, instruments).
- French cleat systems, pegboard, slat walls — the commercial solutions already exist. The pattern is about *where* the tool wall goes (visible, accessible, in the main living zone or immediately adjacent) not *how* it's organized.
- Connection to Repair Culture (#54): if the philosophy is "build to be fixed by inhabitants," the tool wall is the spatial expression of that philosophy. It makes maintenance not just possible but *present* — a daily visual reminder that this building is yours to care for.

**Therefore direction:** In every dwelling, provide a visible, accessible wall or panel where basic repair and maintenance tools are stored in the open — screwdrivers, pliers, hammer, tape measure, level, adjustable wrench, utility knife, flashlight. Place it in or immediately adjacent to the main living area — not in the garage, not in the basement, not behind a closed door. The tool wall should be as natural a part of the home as the bookshelf or the coat hooks. Organize tools by silhouette so gaps are visible. The wall need not be large — one square meter is sufficient for a household toolkit. The test: can you reach the right screwdriver within sixty seconds of noticing a loose hinge?

**Connections:**
- Up: Repair Culture (54), The Owner-Builder (55)
- Down: Seasonal Maintenance Ritual (X-8) — the tool wall is where the maintenance ritual begins
- Lateral: The Community Workshop (57) — the tool wall handles daily repairs; the community workshop handles larger projects. Different scales of the same impulse.

**Confidence rationale:** ★ — the principle is compelling and the workshop precedent is universal. But applying workshop organization to the domestic interior is a design proposition, not a demonstrated norm. The claim that visible tools increase maintenance frequency is logical but unproven. Moderate confidence is honest.

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Any studies on tool accessibility and maintenance behavior
- French cleat / pegboard as standard workshop organization systems
- Kitchen tool visibility as established domestic design precedent (this is self-evident but worth noting as common knowledge, not a research claim)

---

### Pattern X-8: Seasonal Maintenance Ritual ★

**Scale:** Construction (with temporal / behavioral dimension)

**Core tension:** Modern buildings are designed as if maintenance is an emergency rather than a rhythm. Gutters clog until ice dams form. Caulking fails until water penetrates. Furnace filters choke until efficiency drops 30%. The building's needs are invisible until they become failures, because nothing in the design invites regular inspection or care. A garden has seasons — planting, tending, harvesting, putting to bed. A building has seasons too, but nobody designed for them.

**Evidence direction:**
- Japanese building maintenance tradition: the annual house-cleaning (susu harai, literally "soot sweeping") before New Year is a cultural institution, not a chore. The building's maintenance is woven into the calendar.
- Historic building maintenance manuals: the National Trust (UK) and similar organizations publish seasonal maintenance calendars for heritage buildings — spring drainage inspection, summer exterior painting, fall gutter clearing, winter pipe insulation checks. These calendars are practical and specific.
- The economic case: preventive maintenance costs 1/5th to 1/10th of reactive repair. A $50 gutter cleaning prevents a $5,000 ice dam repair. A $200 annual furnace service prevents a $3,000 replacement. The data is well-established in facilities management literature.
- The design requirement: maintenance can only become a ritual if the building makes it *possible*. Gutters must be reachable without a 30-foot ladder. Furnace filters must be accessible without disassembling ductwork. Exterior caulk joints must be visible for inspection. Foundation walls must be inspectable. Roof valleys must be accessible.
- The building manual: every new building should come with a maintenance calendar — a simple one-page document listing seasonal tasks, their locations, and their tools. This exists in commercial construction (facility management plans) but is almost never provided for residential buildings.

**Therefore direction:** Design every building so that seasonal maintenance is physically easy and socially expected. Make gutters reachable from the ground or a low ladder. Make furnace filters accessible without tools. Make caulk joints visible and inspectable. Make roof drainage observable from ground level. Provide a one-page building manual with every new dwelling — a seasonal calendar listing four tasks per season, their locations in the building, and the tools required. Design the maintenance access points as architectural features, not afterthoughts: an inspectable crawl space with a proper door, a mechanical room with room to work, attic access wide enough for a person with a tool belt.

**Connections:**
- Up: Repair Culture (54), The Permanent Frame (X-1), The Tool Wall (X-7)
- Down: (terminal — this pattern's implementation is the maintenance itself)
- Lateral: The Owner-Builder (55) — the maintenance ritual is the lowest-commitment form of owner-building; Building Envelope as Climate System — high-performance envelopes have specific maintenance needs (HRV filters, air barrier inspections)

**Confidence rationale:** ★ — the economic case for preventive maintenance is ironclad. The Japanese and heritage building precedents are real. But the idea of a "maintenance ritual" as a design pattern (not just a facilities management practice) is a proposition, not a proven norm. The building manual concept is well-established in commercial construction but almost unknown in residential. Moderate confidence.

**Claims requiring verification:**
- Japanese susu harai tradition and its contemporary practice
- Preventive vs. reactive maintenance cost ratio (1/5 to 1/10 — source this from FM literature)
- Specific cost examples ($50 gutter cleaning vs. $5,000 ice dam repair — regional and approximate)
- National Trust (UK) seasonal maintenance calendar publication
- Commercial building facility management plan requirements (IBC or ASHRAE references)

### Connections Down (to future patterns or terminals)

Most Category X patterns connect downward to specific material and construction detail patterns that may be generated in later batch phases. For now, X-6 (Hand-Made Detail) and X-8 (Seasonal Maintenance Ritual) are terminal — they're at the finest grain of the language.

## Confidence Distribution

| Rating | Count | Patterns |
|---|---|---|
| ★★ | 4 | Permanent Frame, Visible Structure, Materials That Age, Honest Joinery |
| ★ | 4 | Local Material Radius, Hand-Made Detail, Tool Wall, Seasonal Maintenance |

This matches the editorial notes' recommendation to avoid being top-heavy with ★★ ratings. The four ★★ patterns have strong precedent and measurable criteria. The four ★ patterns have compelling arguments but need more validation.

## Generation Instructions

**For the Pattern Generator tool:**

1. Generate all 8 patterns in the sequence listed (X-1 through X-8)
2. Use the evidence directions and "therefore" directions as starting points, not as final text — the generator should research and expand
3. Run with `--research` flag to ensure evidence is sourced from real publications
4. After generation, run the full quality gate (Red Team + Research Verification) before any pattern is published
5. Pay particular attention to the claims flagged for verification under each pattern

**Numbering:** Final pattern IDs to be assigned during integration with the live catalog. The Category X range in the current system is 54–57. New patterns could extend to 54–65 (shifting later categories) or be assigned to available slots. Resolve numbering during the CC integration session.

**Quality bar:** These patterns carry the deeper philosophy of Language A. They should read like Alexander at his best — warm, specific, human, building from observed reality toward a clear spatial principle. The "therefore" clause of every pattern must be buildable. A contractor reading it should know what to do differently.

---

## Decision Criteria (from Roadmap)

> Does Category X feel like it belongs? Do the construction-scale patterns carry the weight of the deeper philosophy without stating it explicitly? If the patterns about craft, repair, and honest materials don't resonate, the category needs rethinking before it ships.

The test: read the 12-pattern category (existing 4 + new 8) front to back. Does it feel like the construction-scale wing of a real pattern language? Does a person who reads it think differently about how their building is made? If the answer is yes on both counts, ship it. If any pattern reads as filler, cut it — better 10 strong patterns than 12 with padding.
