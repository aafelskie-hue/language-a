      "summary": "Five meters is at the low end of recommended corridor widths; scientific literature typically recommends wider corridors for effective wildlife movement.",
      "detail": "Ecological corridor width recommendations vary significantly based on purpose and target species. For hedgerows and basic wildlife movement, 3-5 meters can provide some habitat value for invertebrates and small mammals. However, most ecological guidelines recommend minimum widths of 10-30 meters for effective wildlife corridors, with some studies suggesting 50-100+ meters for larger fauna. The 5-meter figure may be appropriate for urban green infrastructure or pollinator pathways but is narrow for general 'effective green corridors.'",
