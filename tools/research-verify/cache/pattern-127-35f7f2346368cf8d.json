      "detail": "The National Building Code of Canada specifies ground snow loads (Ss) for each location, with Edmonton's being approximately 1.4-1.6 kPa for ground snow load. However, roof snow loads involve additional factors (accumulation, drift, importance factors) that can result in design loads higher than ground loads. The claim of 3.5 kPa seems high for a basic roof snow load but could reflect specific conditions or combined loads. The phrase 'roofs must shed' is technically imprecise—codes specify structural capacity to support loads, not shedding requirements. Unable to verify exact current figures without web access.",
