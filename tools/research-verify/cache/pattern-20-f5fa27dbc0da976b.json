      "summary": "The claimed range of 100-200 mm/hour is within the typical performance range but represents the lower end of what pervious concrete can achieve.",
      "detail": "Based on technical literature, pervious concrete typically has infiltration rates ranging from about 120 mm/hour (approximately 5 inches/hour) at the low end up to 770+ mm/hour (30+ inches/hour) for well-designed systems. The EPA and concrete industry sources cite minimum rates of around 120-200 mm/hour (5-8 inches/hour) as acceptable performance thresholds, while new installations often perform much higher. The claim's 100-200 mm/hour range is conservative but reasonable for aged or partially clogged systems.",

Based on training knowledge, permeable pavements are generally understood to be cooler than conventional asphalt due to evaporative cooling and reduced heat absorption, but the specific 10-15°C figure requires verification from primary sources like EPA studies or academic research on urban heat island mitigation. The claim is consistent with general scientific understanding but the exact temperature range needs confirmation.",
