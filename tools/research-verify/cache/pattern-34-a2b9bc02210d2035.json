      "detail": "Scientific literature confirms that changing light quality - particularly the shift in color temperature and blue light content throughout the day - is a key circadian zeitgeber (time-giver). However, the mechanism is primarily about spectral composition and intensity changes over time, not 'light from multiple directions.' The claim conflates two separate concepts: directional lighting (an architectural quality) and temporal changes in light spectrum (the actual circadian mechanism).
