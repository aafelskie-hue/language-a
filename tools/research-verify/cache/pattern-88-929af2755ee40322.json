      "detail": "The WHO Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region were published in 2018. However, the guidelines provide source-specific recommendations using Lden and Lnight metrics, not general outdoor noise limits. For road traffic: 53 dB Lden (daytime), 45 dB Lnight (nighttime). For aircraft: 45 dB Lden, 40 dB Lnight. The claim's 55 dB daytime is close to but higher than the road traffic recommendation of 53 dB, and the 40 dB nighttime figure only applies to aircraft noise specifically, not general environmental noise which recommends 45 dB for road traffic.",
