      "detail": "Stewart Brand's influential book 'How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built' was published in 1994 and introduced the concept of 'shearing layers' - six layers that change at different rates: Site (eternal), Structure (30-300 years), Skin (20 years), Services (7-15 years), Space Plan (3-30 years), and Stuff (daily to monthly). The space plan layer encompasses interior layout, partitions, and furniture placement. The claim accurately represents both the publication date and the specific lifespan range for the space plan layer.",

Japanese experiments with Open Building concepts largely began in the 1970s-1980s, including the KEP (Kodan Experimental Project) and CHS (Century Housing System). The claim that it has been 'tested' for over 60 years is approximately correct for the concept's existence, but practical implementation across both countries didn't begin immediately in the early 1960s.",
