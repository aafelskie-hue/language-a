In some regions (like parts of the UK or Northern Europe), 25mm may be reasonable for a 2-year, 24-hour storm. However, in other regions (like the US Southeast), a 2-year storm can exceed 75-100mm. The claim presents a location-specific value as if it were universal. The US EPA and NOAA provide precipitation frequency atlases (like NOAA Atlas 14) that show significant regional variation. Without specifying a location, 25mm is only accurate for certain temperate climates with moderate rainfall.",
