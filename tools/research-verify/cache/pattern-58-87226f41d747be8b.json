      "detail": "Oulu, Finland is indeed known as a 'winter cycling city' and uses some winter-adapted infrastructure. Nordic cities generally do incorporate wind protection in building placement, snow storage planning, and transit shelter design. However, heated sidewalks are expensive and typically limited to specific high-traffic areas (like central squares) rather than 'key intersections' broadly. Without web access to verify current implementations in Tromsø and Luleå specifically, I cannot confirm all five design features are present across all three cities as claimed.",
