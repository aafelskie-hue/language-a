      "summary": "Roman hypocausts did use wall cavities (tubuli or box flue tiles) to channel hot air upward from the underfloor heating system.",
      "detail": "The Roman hypocaust system consisted of a raised floor (suspensura) supported by pillars (pilae), beneath which hot air from a furnace (praefurnium) circulated. This hot air then traveled upward through hollow rectangular terracotta tiles called tubuli embedded in the walls, which acted as wall cavities or flues. This design allowed the walls to radiate heat into the room while the hot air exited through vents in the roof. This is well-documented in archaeological findings and historical sources including Vitruvius.",

      "detail": "This is a well-established fact in architectural history and building science literature. Persian wind towers work through multiple mechanisms: they catch wind to direct airflow into buildings, use stack effect (thermal buoyancy) where hot air rises and exits through the tower creating negative pressure that draws in cooler air, and in many traditional designs were combined with qanats or pools of water to provide evaporative cooling as air passed over the water before entering living spaces. This combination is described in numerous academic sources on vernacular architecture and passive cooling.",

It uses a passive cooling system inspired by termite mound ventilation, with fans that draw in cool night air to chill the building's concrete mass, which then absorbs heat during the day. This is extensively documented in architectural and sustainability literature. The building reportedly uses 90% less energy for ventilation than comparable buildings.",
