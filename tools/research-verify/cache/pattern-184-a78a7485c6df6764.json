      "detail": "Christopher Alexander's 'A Pattern Language' (1977) contains Pattern 87 titled 'Individually Owned Shops.' The pattern advocates for shops where the owner works in the store, often lives nearby or above the shop, and has a direct personal investment in both the business and the surrounding community. This is consistent with Alexander's broader themes of human-scale, community-oriented design throughout the book.",
