      "summary": "Aluminum/foil-backed materials do significantly attenuate WiFi signals, and 30-50 dB is within the plausible range for metal barriers, though specific measurements for foil-backed rigid insulation vary by product and frequency.",
      "detail": "Metal foil and aluminum backing are well-documented WiFi signal blockers. Technical literature generally shows aluminum foil can attenuate WiFi signals by 40-80 dB depending on thickness and frequency. The 30-50 dB range cited is conservative and plausible for thin aluminum facing on insulation boards. However, specific attenuation depends on foil thickness, gaps/seams in installation, and WiFi frequency (2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz). The claim that this creates a 'near-total barrier' is accurate for the upper end of this range—50 dB represents blocking 99.999% of signal power.",

These conductive metallic layers also reflect and attenuate radio frequency signals in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi bands. This is a well-established phenomenon in wireless network planning literature, with attenuation values of 6-30+ dB reported depending on the coating type. Cisco, Aruba, and other enterprise WiFi vendors document this in their RF planning guides.",
