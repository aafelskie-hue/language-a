      "detail": "Jay Appleton was a British geographer who published 'The Experience of Landscape' in 1975 through Wiley. This book introduced prospect-refuge theory, which proposes that humans have an evolved preference for environments that offer both prospect (open views allowing surveillance of the surroundings) and refuge (sheltered spaces offering protection). This is a well-established academic work frequently cited in environmental psychology and landscape architecture literature.",

Their work in the 1980s-1990s, including studies published in venues like 'The Adapted Mind' (1992, edited by Barkow, Cosmides & Tooby), established the 'savanna hypothesis' showing cross-cultural preferences for landscapes with scattered trees, water features, and open sightlines. Their research demonstrated that people consistently rate savanna-like environments higher than dense forests or featureless plains, consistent with the claim.
