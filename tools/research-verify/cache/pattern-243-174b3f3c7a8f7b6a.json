However, the actual fieldwork was conducted earlier in the 1970s as part of his doctoral research at Clark University. The claim conflates the publication date with the study date.

Pattern 203, titled 'Child Caves', discusses how children need small enclosed spaces scaled to their bodies - places to hide, play, and feel protected. This is a well-documented and frequently referenced pattern in the architectural pattern language literature.",

      "detail": "Simon Nicholson published 'How NOT to Cheat Children: The Theory of Loose Parts' in Landscape Architecture magazine in 1971. His core thesis states: 'In any environment, both the degree of inventiveness and creativity, and the possibility of discovery, are directly proportional to the number and kind of variables in it.' The claim accurately represents this foundational principle, though Nicholson's original wording also includes creativity alongside inventiveness, and mentions 'number and kind' rather than just 'number' of variables.",
