      "detail": "Multiple water conservation organizations and academic sources cite that greywater (from showers, sinks, and laundry) typically accounts for 50-80% of residential wastewater, with 60% being a commonly cited middle estimate. The EPA's residential water use data shows toilets account for roughly 24-30% of indoor water use (blackwater), with the remainder being greywater sources. The claim's use of 'approximately' and 'roughly' appropriately acknowledges this is an estimate that varies by household.",
