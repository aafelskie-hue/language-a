      "detail": "This is a well-established fact from the book 'A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction' by Christopher Alexander et al., published in 1977 by Oxford University Press. The pattern addresses the psychological need for a transitional space between public streets and private interiors. Unable to perform live web verification due to permission restrictions, but this is verifiable in the original text and widely documented in architectural and software pattern literature.",
