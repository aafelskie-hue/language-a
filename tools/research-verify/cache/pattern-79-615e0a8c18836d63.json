      "summary": "800 meters in 10 minutes corresponds to 80 meters per minute (4.8 km/h), which is consistent with a slow-to-moderate walking pace.",
      "detail": "Standard walking speeds range from 3-5 km/h for slow walkers to 5-6 km/h for brisk walkers. At 4.8 km/h (80 m/min), 800 meters takes exactly 10 minutes. This is a well-established benchmark in urban planning, where '10-minute walk' and '800 meters' are often used interchangeably for walkability assessments. The claim accurately describes a slow walking pace.",

Based on general knowledge, 150-300 square meters (approximately 1,600-3,200 square feet) is within a plausible range for a small primary care clinic with the described facilities, as individual exam rooms typically require 9-14 square meters each, but I cannot confirm this against authoritative primary sources.",

The World Health Organization and various national health bodies have cited similar figures suggesting primary care addresses the majority of health needs. However, the exact '80%' figure is more of a widely-used approximation than a rigorously measured statistic, with some sources citing figures ranging from 70-90% depending on how 'healthcare needs' are defined and measured. The American Academy of Family Physicians and similar organizations have promoted this general claim.",
