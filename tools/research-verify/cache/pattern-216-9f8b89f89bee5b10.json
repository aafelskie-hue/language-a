      "detail": "Christopher Alexander's 'A Pattern Language' published in 1977 contains 253 patterns for architectural and urban design. Pattern #197 is titled 'THICK WALLS' and discusses how traditional buildings had walls two feet thick or more that created inhabitable zones with window seats, niches, and alcoves. This is a well-established reference in architectural pattern literature.",
