      "detail": "Average household water usage for toilet flushing (approximately 30%), laundry (approximately 20%), and outdoor irrigation (varies widely, 30-50% in some regions) would typically total 50,000-80,000 liters annually for a 2-3 person household in temperate climates. The 100,000 liter figure is high but could be accurate for a larger household or one with significant irrigation needs in a drier climate. The claim is directionally correct but may overstate typical needs or understate what 100,000 liters can cover.",
