The claim is plausible given general research on nature sounds and relaxation, but the specific percentage range requires verification against actual study data.",

      "detail": "Research by Eleanor Ratcliffe and colleagues (notably a 2013 study published in Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics and subsequent work) has specifically examined how birdsong affects perceived restorativeness. Studies in environmental psychology journals have consistently found that natural sounds including birdsong enhance ratings of pleasantness and restoration compared to urban/mechanical sounds. The claim aligns with well-established findings in soundscape research.",
