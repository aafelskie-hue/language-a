Adding a second layer of drywall on each side (double drywall) typically improves this to STC 38-40 range. However, achieving a solid STC 40 often requires additional measures such as resilient channels, acoustic sealant, or insulation in the cavity. The claim is directionally correct but STC 40 represents the upper end of what double drywall alone achieves.",

According to acoustical engineering references and building construction guides, this assembly type routinely achieves STC ratings of 55-65+, depending on additional factors like insulation, drywall layers, and gap width. The claim of 'STC 55 or higher' is consistent with published construction specifications from sources like the National Research Council Canada, USG, and various acoustical consultancies.",

      "detail": "The general acoustic principle that mass-air-mass configurations (two doors with a vestibule/air gap) provide better sound isolation than a single barrier is well-established in acoustics. STC ratings do not add linearly - two STC-30 doors would not equal STC-60. However, the air gap breaks the direct transmission path and provides additional decoupling. Industry guidance typically suggests two lesser-rated doors with proper spacing can outperform a single higher-rated door. Without web search access, I cannot verify the exact STC-30 vs STC-45 comparison or find primary sources.",
