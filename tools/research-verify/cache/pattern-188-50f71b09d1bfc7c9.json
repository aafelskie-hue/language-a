CWPPs are voluntary plans that communities can develop to prioritize areas for hazardous fuel reduction treatments. The law provides incentives for communities with CWPPs (such as priority for federal hazardous fuel reduction funding) but does not require communities to create them. The claim incorrectly characterizes CWPPs as 'mandated' when they are actually incentivized and authorized.",

      "detail": "The claim conflates two distinct practices. The glacis (open sloping ground outside walls) was primarily designed for military purposes: preventing enemies from approaching unseen, providing clear fields of fire for defenders, and making siege works difficult. Fire breaks within medieval cities were sometimes mandated after major fires (like London's building codes after various fires), but open ground outside walls was not primarily designed as fire defense against armies. The claim that cities maintained this space against 'fire that followed' armies overstates the intentionality of fire prevention in wall-adjacent open spaces.",
