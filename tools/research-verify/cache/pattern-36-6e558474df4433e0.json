      "detail": "The concept of positive vs negative outdoor space is foundational in urban design theory, originating from Christopher Alexander's work. Alexander defines positive outdoor space as convex, enclosed spaces that feel like rooms (courtyards, plazas) where people linger, versus negative/shapeless leftover spaces that people merely pass through. This distinction has been validated through decades of urban design observation and practice, including the work of Jan Gehl and William H. Whyte's 'Street Life Project' studies.",
