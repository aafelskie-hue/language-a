      "detail": "This statistic appears in numerous facilities management publications and is commonly attributed to various sources including the U.S. Department of Energy and industry associations like IFMA. However, the exact multiplier varies by source - some cite 2-3x, others 4-5x, and some as high as 10x depending on the asset type and industry. The claim is directionally accurate and within the commonly cited range, but 'facilities management research' is vague attribution since no single definitive study is universally cited for this figure.",

      "detail": "Based on industry sources, ice dam removal and repair typically costs $400-$2,000 for removal alone, with water damage repairs from ice dams ranging from $1,500-$10,000+, making the $2,000-$5,000 range reasonable for significant ice dam damage repair. However, professional gutter cleaning typically averages $100-$250 for most homes, with $50 being on the very low end (only realistic for small, single-story homes or DIY). The preventive relationship between gutter cleaning and ice dams is also somewhat oversimplified—clogged gutters are one contributing factor, but ice dams are primarily caused by heat loss from the attic.",
