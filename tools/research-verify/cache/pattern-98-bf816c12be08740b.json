      "summary": "Research does show residential satisfaction declining with building height, but the specific four-story threshold is an approximation from various studies rather than a single definitive finding.",
      "detail": "This claim appears to reference classic environmental psychology research, particularly work by Oscar Newman on defensible space and studies by Clare Cooper Marcus on housing satisfaction. Research does consistently show negative correlations between building height and residential satisfaction, particularly in family housing. However, the exact threshold varies by study - some cite 3 stories, others 5-6 stories, and the effect depends heavily on factors like family composition (families with children show stronger effects), building design, and neighborhood context. The 'four stories' figure is a reasonable synthesis but not a precise universal threshold from any single definitive study.",
