      "summary": "Building depreciation causing older structures to have lower rents/prices than newer comparable buildings is a well-established principle in real estate economics.",
      "detail": "This claim reflects the fundamental concept of building depreciation in real estate economics. Buildings depreciate over time due to physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and external obsolescence. This is documented in standard real estate appraisal methodology (the cost approach explicitly accounts for depreciation), hedonic pricing models that consistently find negative coefficients for building age, and IRS depreciation schedules that assume buildings lose value over 27.5 years (residential) or 39 years (commercial). The principle is so established it forms the basis of property tax assessments and real estate valuation standards.",
