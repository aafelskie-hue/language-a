The concept was pioneered by architect Jan Gudmand-Høyer, who published an influential article in 1968 describing the model. The term 'bofællesskab' (living community) was used in Denmark before 'cohousing' was coined in English. While some trace the conceptual origins to 1967-1968, the first physical communities were built in the early 1970s, making the claim '1970s' accurate.",

The stated range of $800-$1,500 reasonably captures what woodworkers would consider a 'decent' (quality but not professional-grade) table saw.

Common guidance suggests 3-4 feet (approximately 1 meter) of clearance on all sides for safe operation, which would translate to a larger total footprint when considering the machine itself plus surrounding clearance. The 3 square meters figure seems low if interpreted as total workspace, but could be plausible if interpreted as clearance space excluding the saw's footprint.
