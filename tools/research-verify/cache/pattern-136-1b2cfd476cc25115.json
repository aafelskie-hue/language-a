      "detail": "The Roman impluvium is one of the most well-documented features of Roman domestic architecture. It was a rectangular basin set into the floor of the atrium, positioned directly beneath the compluvium (the roof opening). Rainwater would fall through the compluvium and be collected in the impluvium, often draining into a cistern below for household use. This is described extensively in ancient sources including Vitruvius's De Architectura, and physical examples are preserved at Pompeii and Herculaneum.",

These bottle-shaped underground chambers were carved into the soft limestone bedrock common throughout the Maya lowlands. While their uses varied (including storage of food, water, and other materials), water cistern function is well-attested, particularly in regions like the Puuc hills where surface water was scarce. Major archaeological studies at sites like Tikal, Uxmal, and Labná have documented hundreds of these structures.",
