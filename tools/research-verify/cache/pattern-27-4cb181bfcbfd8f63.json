      "detail": "Multiple commercial real estate reports from CBRE, JLL, and Cushman & Wakefield documented office vacancy rates exceeding 20% in numerous major North American cities by 2023-2024. San Francisco reached over 30%, while cities like Houston, Dallas, Denver, Calgary, and others exceeded 20%. The national US average itself approached or exceeded 20% by late 2023. This is well-documented across commercial real estate industry reports.",

      "detail": "This measurement aligns with well-documented architectural principles regarding natural daylight penetration in office buildings. Research on daylighting (including studies referenced in LEED and BREEAM standards) establishes that effective daylight zones extend approximately 4.5-6 meters from windows, and typical office floor plates are designed with 12-18 meter spans from perimeter to core on each side, totaling roughly 24-36 meters building width. The 20-30 meter depth from window wall to core represents one side of this configuration and is a standard figure cited in architectural practice literature.",

      "detail": "These figures align with established architectural standards. Commercial office buildings typically have floor-to-floor heights of 3.5-4.0 meters (approximately 11.5-13 feet) to accommodate raised floors for cabling, suspended ceilings for HVAC and lighting, and higher ceiling clearances expected in professional settings. Residential buildings typically range from 2.7-3.0 meters (approximately 9-10 feet), which is sufficient for standard ceiling heights of 2.4-2.7 meters plus structural floor depth. These ranges are widely cited in architectural reference materials and building design guides. However, verification is limited to general knowledge rather than primary source confirmation.",
