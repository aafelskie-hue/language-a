The 90% water reduction figure is consistent with broadly accepted aquaponics efficiency claims, which typically cite 80-95% less water usage compared to conventional soil-based agriculture due to water recirculation. This figure appears in multiple aquaponics research papers and educational materials referencing the UVI system.",

However, trout are cold-water fish that actually prefer temperatures between 10-18°C and can tolerate temperatures as low as 4°C, becoming stressed at temperatures above 20°C. This makes the blanket statement misleading as it conflates species with opposite temperature requirements. Perch (yellow perch) are cool-water fish tolerant of a wide range (4-25°C).",
