      "detail": "Using standard R-value to U-value conversion formulas: R-40 (imperial) equals RSI-7.04, giving a U-value of approximately 0.142 W/m²K. Dividing the window U-value (0.85) by the wall U-value (0.142) yields a ratio of approximately 6:1, not 3:1 as stated. The claim significantly understates the thermal performance gap between the window and wall. This is based on well-established building physics conversion factors (1 R-value imperial = 0.176 RSI).",
