      "detail": "The right to repair movement is a globally recognized advocacy movement that has been active for over a decade, focusing on consumers' and independent repair shops' ability to repair electronic devices. Major organizations include iFixit, The Repair Association, and PIRG's Right to Repair campaign. The movement has resulted in legislation in multiple U.S. states (New York, California, Minnesota, Colorado) and EU regulations requiring manufacturers to provide repair information and spare parts for electronics.",

      "detail": "This claim reflects widely acknowledged design trends documented by consumer advocacy groups like iFixit, EU right-to-repair legislation rationale, and repair industry economics. The claim is technically accurate: sealed batteries (smartphones, laptops), proprietary pentalobe screws (Apple), glued screens (tablets), and welded components (appliances) demonstrably increase repair complexity and cost. While I cannot provide specific URLs due to tool access limitations, this is established industry knowledge supported by iFixit repairability scores, FTC reports on repair restrictions, and EU/US right-to-repair legislative findings.",
