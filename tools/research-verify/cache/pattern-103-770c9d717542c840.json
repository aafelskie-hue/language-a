      "detail": "The Cotswolds is renowned for its distinctive architecture built from local oolitic limestone, commonly called Cotswold stone. This honey-golden limestone has been quarried locally for centuries and is the defining characteristic of villages throughout the region. The stone varies slightly in color depending on the exact quarry location, ranging from pale cream to deep honey gold.",

The assertion that river-clay brickyards were among the first industries in prairie towns and led to widespread brick construction is a plausible historical pattern consistent with 19th century settlement, but I could not access sources to confirm or deny the specifics.
