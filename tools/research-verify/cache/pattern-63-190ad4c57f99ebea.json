      "summary": "The Swedish word 'gångbro' exists but primarily means 'footbridge' or 'pedestrian bridge', not specifically covered walkways between farmstead buildings.",
      "detail": "In Swedish, 'gångbro' is a compound word from 'gång' (walking/passage) and 'bro' (bridge), and it typically refers to a footbridge or pedestrian walkway/bridge. While covered walkways between farm buildings did exist in traditional Scandinavian architecture (sometimes called 'svalgång' or similar terms), the specific claim that 'gångbro' refers to covered walkways between farmstead buildings appears to be either a regional usage or a conflation with other architectural terms. Without web search access, I cannot definitively verify whether 'gångbro' has this specific meaning in traditional Swedish farmstead architecture contexts.",

      "detail": "The engawa (縁側) is a well-documented feature of traditional Japanese residential architecture. It refers to a wooden-floored, often covered, transitional space between the interior rooms and the garden, functioning as a veranda or porch. The term is widely used in architectural literature and Japanese culture studies. While some engawa may be uncovered or partially covered, the characterization as a 'covered veranda' is accurate for many traditional examples.",
