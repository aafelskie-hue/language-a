      "detail": "Based on my knowledge through May 2025, InPost is indeed a major parcel locker operator in Poland, UK, and France. By late 2023/early 2024, InPost reported operating approximately 38,000-42,000 lockers across their European network, with the majority in Poland (around 20,000+), significant presence in UK, and growing operations in France. The 'over 40,000' figure is plausible but should be verified against their most recent investor reports for exact current numbers.",

Industry reports consistently cite Poland's overall parcel locker share of e-commerce deliveries at around 30-40% nationally, with higher concentrations in major cities like Warsaw.
