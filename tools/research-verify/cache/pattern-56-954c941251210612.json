      "detail": "Wood darkening over time is caused by UV exposure and oxidation of lignin and other compounds. Copper patina (verdigris) is a well-documented oxidation process where copper reacts with oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide to form copper carbonate. Stone weathering through physical, chemical, and biological processes is a fundamental concept in geology and building conservation. These are basic materials science facts that do not require web search verification as they represent established scientific knowledge found in any materials science or geology textbook.",
