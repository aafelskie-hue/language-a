It refers to an earthen-floored area at ground level, typically located at the entrance and extending to the kitchen area, where cooking, food preparation, and other work activities took place. The earthen floor (packed dirt, sometimes finished with clay or concrete in later periods) distinguished it from the raised wooden floor sections of the house.",

The claim's 30-45 minute range is accurate for some foods but not universally applicable to all high-acid canning. The 21-liter pot size claim is reasonable for quart jars.",
