In Europe, the European Environment Agency and WHO have documented extreme heat as the deadliest weather phenomenon, particularly highlighted after the 2003 European heatwave that killed over 70,000 people. This claim aligns with established public health data from both regions.",

British Columbia alone reported over 500 deaths, with additional deaths in Washington and Oregon. Some estimates including delayed or indirect heat deaths put the toll significantly higher. The 'over 600' figure is a reasonable conservative estimate consistent with official reports.",

The CDC and other health agencies generally recommend indoor temperatures between 24-26°C (75-78°F) during heat events, with lower thresholds for elderly and vulnerable individuals. The claim of 26°C is reasonable for general population but may be too high for vulnerable groups. Different standards exist: ASHRAE recommends thermal comfort zones, while emergency heat guidelines often cite lower thresholds.",
