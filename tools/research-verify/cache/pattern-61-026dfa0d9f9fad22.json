      "detail": "This is a verifiable astronomical fact. At 50°N latitude (e.g., Prague, Winnipeg, Frankfurt), winter solstice daylight is approximately 8 hours and 4-6 minutes depending on exact location. North of this latitude, daylight decreases further - at 55°N it drops to around 7 hours, and at 60°N to about 5.5-6 hours. The claim that winter daylight 'drops below eight hours' north of 50° is technically correct, though at exactly 50°N it's very close to 8 hours.",

This standard is supported by extensive research and is recommended by major medical institutions including the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the American Psychiatric Association. At 10,000 lux, treatment sessions typically last 20-30 minutes, whereas lower intensities (e.g., 2,500 lux) require longer exposure times (2+ hours) for equivalent therapeutic effect.",
