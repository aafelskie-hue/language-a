      "detail": "This is a well-established historical fact in political science and urban planning literature. Porto Alegre initiated participatory budgeting in 1989 when the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores) took control of the city government. The practice allowed citizens to directly influence municipal budget decisions and became a model replicated in thousands of cities worldwide. This origin story is consistently cited in academic sources including the World Bank, UN-Habitat, and numerous peer-reviewed studies.",

      "detail": "New York City's participatory budgeting program was launched in 2011-2012 by four City Council members and grew to include most council districts. Over its duration, it allocated well over $200 million in capital funds (far exceeding 'tens of millions') for projects selected by residents including parks, schools, libraries, and public housing improvements. The program ran for approximately a decade before being suspended during COVID-19. The claim's characterization of 'tens of millions' actually understates the total funding.",
