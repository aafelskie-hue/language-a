The Bureau of Labor Statistics American Time Use Survey also showed similar figures in the 5-6% range for 2019. The claim of 'roughly 5%' is an accurate approximation of these official statistics.",

The Bureau of Labor Statistics and various surveys showed remote/hybrid work settling in the 20-30% range depending on how 'primarily from home' is defined. The exact 27% figure would need verification against official 2025 BLS data or authoritative surveys like Pew Research. The general trend of stabilization around this range is directionally accurate.",
