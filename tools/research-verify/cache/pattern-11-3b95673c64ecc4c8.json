      "detail": "This is a well-documented pattern from Alexander's seminal 1977 book 'A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction.' The book contains 253 patterns, and #112 'Entrance Transition' addresses the need for a gradual transition between public streets and private indoor spaces. Unable to perform live web verification due to tool restrictions, but this matches established knowledge of the text.",

Norway is the world leader in EV adoption, driven by strong tax incentives, charging infrastructure, and policies favoring zero-emission vehicles. The claim of 'over 80%' is accurate and actually conservative given recent figures.",
