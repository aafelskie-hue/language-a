Published in Science (Vol. 224, Issue 4647, pp. 420-421, April 27, 1984), the study examined cholecystectomy patients at a Pennsylvania hospital and found those with bedside windows looking out on a natural scene had shorter postoperative hospital stays, received fewer negative evaluative comments in nurses' notes, and took fewer potent analgesics than matched patients with windows facing a brick wall. The claim accurately represents the study's key finding.",

The claim involves two assertions: (1) that HVAC engineers use the term 'pink noise' and (2) that fountains produce pink noise/broadband sound. From general knowledge, pink noise is a real acoustic engineering term referring to sound with equal energy per octave (as opposed to white noise which has equal energy per frequency). Sound masking systems in buildings do use pink noise or similar spectra. However, whether fountains specifically produce 'pink noise' rather than 'white noise' or other broadband spectra requires verification with sources.",
