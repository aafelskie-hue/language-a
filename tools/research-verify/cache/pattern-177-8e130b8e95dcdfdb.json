The plan included narrow service lanes (typically 6-10 meters wide) between the main streets, originally intended for rear access to properties, deliveries, sanitation, and utilities - classic Victorian-era service functions. These laneways were integral to the original street design, not later additions. They later transformed into the cultural and retail spaces Melbourne is now famous for.",

Newman's research at Pruitt-Igoe and other housing projects demonstrated that design features enabling residents to see and monitor shared spaces correlated with reduced crime and increased feelings of safety.",
