      "detail": "Passive solar greenhouse design literature generally recommends R-20 to R-30 for insulated walls (north, east, west) in cold climates, with R-40 representing best practice for extremely cold climates (USDA zones 3-4 or colder). The USDA and various extension services typically cite R-19 to R-30 as adequate for most cold climate greenhouses. R-40 is appropriate for very cold regions but stating it as the baseline recommendation may be overly stringent for moderately cold climates. The claim is directionally correct but R-40 represents the upper range rather than a standard recommendation.",
