In northern U.S. states and Canada, frost line depths commonly range from 1.2m (4 feet) in moderately cold areas to over 2m (6+ feet) in very cold regions like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and northern Canada. The claim's range of 1.5 to 2 meters is well within documented requirements for cold climates.",

In colder climates (higher AFI), horizontal extensions can range from approximately 0.3 meters (12 inches) in milder frost areas to over 1.8 meters (72 inches) in severe cold climates. The 1.2 meter figure falls within the typical range but is not a universal minimum requirement. The actual requirement depends on climate zone, building heat loss characteristics, and whether the building is heated or unheated.",
