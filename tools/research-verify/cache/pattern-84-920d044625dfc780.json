      "detail": "This is an established principle in architectural daylighting design. Splayed reveals (angled outward from the window toward the room interior) allow light entering at oblique angles to reflect off the reveal surfaces and penetrate deeper into the room. This technique is documented in historic architecture (medieval churches, traditional vernacular buildings) and modern daylighting manuals. The physics is straightforward: angled surfaces reflect light at angles that direct it further into the room rather than absorbing it on perpendicular surfaces.",
