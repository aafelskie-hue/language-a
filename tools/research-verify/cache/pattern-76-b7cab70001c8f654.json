      "detail": "The Safe Routes to School program, various state education guidelines, and urban planning standards commonly reference 1 mile (approximately 15-20 minute walk) as the standard walk zone for elementary schools. The U.S. EPA, ASCE, and multiple state education departments use similar thresholds. The 15-minute standard aligns with walkability research showing that distances beyond this threshold significantly reduce walking rates among children. Many school districts define 'hazardous walking conditions' exemptions starting at or beyond 1 mile for elementary students.",
