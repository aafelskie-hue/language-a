      "detail": "Until the 19th-20th century industrialization of construction, the vast majority of human dwellings were vernacular architecture built by inhabitants, their families, and communities using local materials and traditional techniques. Professional architects and specialized builders were historically rare and served primarily elites. Bernard Rudofsky's 'Architecture Without Architects' (1964) and subsequent scholarship in vernacular architecture studies document that owner-built and community-built housing was the norm across cultures and time periods.",
