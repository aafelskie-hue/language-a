      "detail": "The CDC's Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and related guidance do include stair climbing as an example of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and encourage taking stairs as a way to incorporate physical activity into daily routines. However, I cannot verify that the CDC specifically ranks or identifies it as 'one of the most accessible' forms of exercise - this characterization may be an interpretation rather than direct CDC language. The CDC tends to list multiple accessible activities (walking, biking, dancing, etc.) without ranking their accessibility.",

      "detail": "Research published in journals including the British Journal of Sports Medicine and studies from institutions like McMaster University have demonstrated that stair climbing is an effective form of exercise for cardiovascular health. A 2019 study found that climbing just a few flights of stairs multiple times daily improves cardiorespiratory fitness. The claim's framing of 'three flights twice daily' (approximately 60 stairs) aligns with research showing cardiovascular benefits from brief bouts of vigorous stair climbing accumulated throughout the day.",
