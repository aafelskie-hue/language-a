The 1999 guidelines recommend 30 dB LAeq for bedrooms during sleep (not 35 dB), and 35 dB LAeq for classrooms/schools. The 40 dB figure for concentrated work is approximately correct for some settings. Without web access to verify current WHO publications, I cannot confirm the exact figures claimed. The values 35 dB for sleeping and 40 dB for work are commonly cited approximations but may differ from official WHO documentation.",

      "detail": "A television at normal volume typically produces 60-70 dB(A) at the source. Standard interior walls (single-layer drywall) have an STC rating of 30-35, meaning they reduce sound by approximately 30-35 dB. This would result in transmitted sound levels of roughly 25-40 dB(A) through the wall, not 45-55 dB(A). The 45-55 dB(A) figure is closer to the source level of a TV at moderate volume, not the transmitted level. Without web access to verify current acoustic engineering sources, this assessment is based on standard acoustical principles.",

The WHO Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region (2018) and various national standards (such as those from the UK, Germany, and US EPA) consistently report that moderate residential street traffic produces noise levels in the 55-70 dB(A) range at facades. Light residential traffic is typically 50-60 dB(A), while busier residential streets reach 60-70 dB(A), making 55-65 dB(A) a reasonable middle estimate.",
