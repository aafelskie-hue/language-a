      "detail": "The claim originates from 'One False Move: A Study of Children's Independent Mobility' (1990) by Mayer Hillman, John Adams, and John Whitelegg, published by the Policy Studies Institute. The study found that around 80% of 7-8 year old children in England walked to school without adult supervision in 1971, compared to dramatically lower rates by 1990. This is a frequently cited and well-established statistic in urban planning and child development literature. I was unable to verify via live web search due to permission constraints, but this statistic is consistent with my training data on Hillman's research.",

At 30 km/h, pedestrian fatality risk is approximately 10%, while at 50 km/h it rises to approximately 80-90%. This is based on human biomechanical tolerance to impact forces. The UN Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety and numerous national traffic safety organizations recommend 30 km/h limits for residential streets and areas where vulnerable road users, especially children, are present.",
