Section 306.3.1 requires knee clearance to be 27 inches high minimum, 30 inches wide minimum, and the depth requirements are specified in 306.3.3 as extending 25 inches maximum at the floor level with knee clearance at 11 inches minimum at 9 inches above the floor, and 8 inches minimum at 27 inches above the floor. The 19 inches deep figure appears to be a simplification or possible misreading - the actual knee clearance depth requirement is more complex and measured at specific heights. The 27 inches high and 30 inches wide are accurate.",
