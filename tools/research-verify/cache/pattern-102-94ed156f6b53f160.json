These changes were based on research conducted by the International Code Council and others on the fire safety performance of mass timber. The claim accurately states that IV-A permits 18 stories, though the other types have lower limits.",

      "summary": "The charring behavior of large timber sections in fire is a well-established principle in fire engineering and building science.",
      "detail": "When large timber (mass timber) sections are exposed to fire, the outer layer chars at a predictable rate (approximately 0.6-0.8mm per minute for softwoods). This char layer has low thermal conductivity and acts as an insulating barrier, protecting the inner wood which retains its structural properties. This is a fundamental principle documented in building codes (IBC), fire engineering standards (Eurocode 5, ASTM E119), and extensively researched by organizations like the Forest Products Laboratory and WoodWorks. Unlike steel which loses strength rapidly at elevated temperatures, the predictable charring rate of timber allows engineers to design for fire resistance.",
