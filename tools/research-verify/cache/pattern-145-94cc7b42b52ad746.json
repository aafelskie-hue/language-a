      "detail": "Building science and indoor air quality research consistently cites figures in this range. A person produces approximately 1-2 liters of moisture per day through respiration and perspiration alone. Cooking adds 2-3 liters per day, bathing/showering adds 1.5-2 liters per use, and other activities like dishwashing and laundry contribute additional moisture. For a family of four, totals of 10-15 liters daily are widely cited in ventilation and moisture control guidelines from sources like ASHRAE and building science organizations.",

From training knowledge, ACH50 is typically a whole-building metric rather than a wall-specific metric, and 1.5 ACH50 falls between Passive House (0.6) and typical codes (3-7), but I could not verify if 1.5 ACH50 is specifically recognized as a 'wall air tightness' standard.

This unit (ng/Pa·s·m²) is the SI unit for water vapor permeance, where 1 US perm ≈ 57.4 ng/Pa·s·m². Thus 1,400 ng/Pa·s·m² would equal approximately 24 perms, which is in the range typically associated with highly vapor-permeable materials. However, I was unable to access web sources to verify this specific threshold value against building codes or standards like ASHRAE or IRC. Common thresholds vary by climate zone and application.",
