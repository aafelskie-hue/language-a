However, I recall the project was developed in phases starting around 2009-2012, with initial planting beginning around 2012-2014. The acreage is commonly cited as approximately 7 acres, though some sources indicate the initial phase was smaller (around 2 acres) with expansion plans.

The pattern calls for planting trees and grass strips along streets to provide shade, beauty, and environmental benefits. The pattern specifically recommends continuous planted areas rather than isolated plantings. My confidence is 0.9 rather than 1.0 because I cannot perform a live web search to confirm the exact wording about 'continuous planted strips along every street and path.'",

Berry bushes like raspberries, blackberries, and currants commonly produce in their first or second year after planting. Herbaceous perennials (herbs, perennial vegetables) often yield in their first growing season or second year. These timeframes are well-documented in permaculture and horticulture literature.",
