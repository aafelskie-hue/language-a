      "summary": "Neuroaesthetics research does study aesthetic responses to handmade vs. machine-made objects, but the specific framing of 'intention vs. error' interpretation is an inference rather than a directly verified finding.",
      "detail": "Neuroaesthetics is a legitimate field studying brain responses to aesthetic stimuli. Research by Semir Zeki and others has examined how the brain responds to art and craftsmanship. Studies have shown that people perceive handmade items differently from machine-made ones, often attributing greater value and authenticity to irregularities in handmade objects. However, the specific claim that the brain interprets handmade irregularity 'as evidence of intention rather than error' is a reasonable interpretation of broader research rather than a directly quoted finding. Without web access, I cannot verify specific papers making this exact claim.",
