However, the phrase 'which are natural, soft, and have weight' appears to be a condensed paraphrase rather than a direct quotation. Alexander's actual prose is more expansive, discussing these qualities across multiple sentences rather than in this compact formulation. The core concepts are accurately represented, but presenting it as a direct quote with quotation marks may be imprecise.",
