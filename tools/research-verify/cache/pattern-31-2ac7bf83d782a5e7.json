The EPA's indoor air quality program has cited this figure for decades, noting that indoor concentrations of some pollutants can be 2-5 times higher than outdoor concentrations, and occasionally up to 100 times higher. This statistic appears in multiple EPA publications on indoor air quality.",

This figure comes from EPA's indoor air quality research and has been cited in their 'Inside Story: A Guide to Indoor Air Quality' document and numerous other sources. The statistic is often referenced in discussions of indoor environmental quality, sick building syndrome, and building design.",

      "detail": "ASHRAE Standard 62.2 (Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Residential Buildings) is the primary U.S. standard for residential ventilation. However, ASHRAE 62.2 typically specifies ventilation rates in CFM based on floor area and number of bedrooms, not as a fixed ACH value. The 0.3 ACH figure has been cited in various building codes and energy standards as a reasonable continuous ventilation rate for dwellings. Some energy codes (like IECC) and programs (like Passive House) reference similar rates. The claim is directionally appropriate but 'standard' is slightly imprecise since the primary standard uses a different calculation method.",
