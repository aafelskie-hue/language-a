However, Brand's original lifespans vary slightly in some sources: Structure is typically cited as 30-300 years (correct), Skin as 20 years (the claim says '20+'), Services as 7-15 years (correct), Space Plan as 3-30 years (though some sources cite 3-7 years for commercial, longer for domestic). The 'eternal' for site and 'daily' for stuff are accurate characterizations. The claim is substantially correct but without web verification I cannot confirm exact wording from the primary source.",

      "detail": "N. John Habraken published 'De dragers en de mensen' (Supports: An Alternative to Mass Housing) in 1961 in the Netherlands, introducing the support/infill concept. The approach was tested through SAR (Stichting Architecten Research) in the Netherlands in the 1960s-70s and later influenced Japanese housing through the SI (Skeleton-Infill) housing movement. As of 2024-2025, this would be approximately 63-64 years since the original publication, making 'over sixty years' accurate. However, actual built implementations came several years after the 1961 publication, so 'built and tested for over sixty years' may slightly overstate the timeline by a few years depending on when the first implementations were completed.",
