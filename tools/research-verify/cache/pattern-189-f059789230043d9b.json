It was developed after California's devastating 1991 Oakland Hills fire and subsequent WUI fires, and has been updated multiple times since its initial adoption around 2005. The code specifies requirements for roofing, exterior walls, vents, decking, and other building components to resist wildfire ignition.",

The code requires vents to resist ember intrusion, but the specific mesh requirements include provisions for 1/16-inch mesh (not just 1/8-inch) for certain vent types, and some code updates have refined these requirements. The claim of '1/8-inch or smaller' is directionally correct but may not capture the full technical specification, which varies by vent location and type. Without current web access to verify the exact current code language, I cannot confirm the precise specification.",
