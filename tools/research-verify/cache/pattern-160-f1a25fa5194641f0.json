      "detail": "This is a well-established principle in acoustic treatment: thicker absorbers are needed to control lower frequencies. A 25mm (approximately 1 inch) porous absorber is effective at high/mid frequencies but provides minimal bass absorption because the wavelength of low frequencies (e.g., 100Hz = ~3.4m wavelength) far exceeds the panel depth. The rule of thumb is that porous absorbers work best when their thickness is at least 1/4 of the sound wavelength. At 100mm (4 inches), absorbers begin to affect frequencies down to approximately 250-350Hz, moving into low-mid territory. This is documented in acoustic engineering literature including works by Cox & D'Antonio 'Acoustic Absorbers and Diffusers'.",
