Following this landmark decision, Euclidean zoning (named after the Euclid, Ohio case) rapidly spread across American cities. By 1930, hundreds of municipalities had adopted zoning ordinances, and the trend continued through the 1930s. The Standard State Zoning Enabling Act (1924) and Standard City Planning Enabling Act (1928) provided model legislation that facilitated this spread.",
