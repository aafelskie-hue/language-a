The claim of 1939 is not entirely accurate if referring to the main house. The architectural feature of a low-ceilinged entry corridor (compression-release technique) is well-documented as a signature Wright design element present at Fallingwater, where the entry has notably lower ceilings before opening to the dramatic main living space.",

This compression-release technique is extensively documented in architectural literature and is a signature element of Wright's spatial philosophy. The Robie House specifically features this low entry as part of Wright's approach to controlling spatial experience.",

      "detail": "Frank Lloyd Wright's 1939 Johnson Wax Administration Building is renowned for its architectural sequence of compression and release. The entrance is intentionally low and narrow, creating a sense of compression before visitors enter the Great Workroom - a dramatic open space supported by approximately 60 iconic lily-pad or mushroom-shaped columns (dendriform columns) that create what is often described as a 'forest of columns.' This technique of using a constricted approach before a grand columned space is a classic Wright spatial strategy.",
