This was widely covered in media outlets at the time of release. Note that the figure is based on self-reported survey data rather than device tracking.",

      "detail": "Standard RF engineering references and WiFi deployment guides (from Cisco, NETGEAR, and academic sources) consistently cite concrete walls as causing approximately 10-15 dB of attenuation at 2.4 GHz frequencies, with higher attenuation at 5 GHz. The exact value depends on wall thickness, concrete density, and presence of rebar. Thinner concrete or concrete block may be on the lower end (10-12 dB), while thick reinforced concrete can exceed 15 dB. The claimed range of 10-15 dB per wall is a well-established engineering approximation.",

The 8-12 dB range cited is well within the commonly reported values for single-layer dense masonry construction.

Two such walls would cumulatively produce approximately 20-30 dB of attenuation, making the claimed 20-25 dB range reasonable and consistent with engineering standards.
