      "summary": "Australian stormwater guidelines do require overland flow path consideration for major storm events, but requirements vary by state/territory and the specific ARI threshold is not universally 1-in-100-year.",
      "detail": "Australia uses Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) guidelines and state-based stormwater management frameworks that do require developments to consider overland flow paths for major storm events. However, the specific recurrence interval varies by jurisdiction - some use 1% AEP (equivalent to 1-in-100-year), while others may use different thresholds. The requirement to protect buildings from flooding via defined overland flow paths is a common principle in Australian stormwater management, but calling it a single national 'guideline' oversimplifies the state-based regulatory framework.",
