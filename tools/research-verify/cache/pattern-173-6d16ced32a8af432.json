      "detail": "Standard door construction includes a door stop (typically 1/2 to 3/4 inch) that the door closes against, and when open at 90 degrees, the door thickness (typically 1-3/8 to 1-3/4 inches for interior doors) reduces the passable opening. A 30-inch door typically provides approximately 27-28 inches of clear opening, while a 32-inch door provides approximately 29-30 inches. This is why ADA requires a minimum 32-inch nominal door width to achieve the required 32-inch clear opening, which is measured with the door open 90 degrees. The specific figures of 27-29 inches for 30-32 inch doors align with standard industry measurements.",

The header itself extends beyond the rough opening to rest on jack studs, typically adding 3 inches total (1.5 inches per side). The claim that a 36-inch door requires '6 additional inches of header' compared to a 30-inch door is technically correct in terms of the difference in rough opening width (36+2 vs 30+2 = 6 inches), but this is a confusing way to describe it. Header sizing is about span width, not 'additional inches.'",
