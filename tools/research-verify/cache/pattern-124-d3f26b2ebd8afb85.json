In continental interiors, semi-arid regions, and areas with low humidity, diurnal ranges of 10-15°C are typical and well-documented. Humid coastal areas tend to have smaller ranges (5-10°C), while deserts can exceed 20°C. The 10-15°C figure represents a reasonable mid-range estimate for many temperate continental locations.
