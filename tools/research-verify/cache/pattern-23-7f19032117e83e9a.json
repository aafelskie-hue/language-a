Well-designed sunspaces with south-facing glazing, thermal mass, and proper insulation can achieve substantial temperature differentials on sunny winter days.

The actual gain depends heavily on solar radiation intensity, glazing area, thermal mass, insulation, and outdoor conditions.",

The 30-degree tolerance allows flexibility while maintaining approximately 90% of optimal solar gain.",
