The claimed values of STC 35 and IIC 32 fall squarely within these established ranges for untreated assemblies. These baseline values are commonly cited in building acoustics references as the starting point before adding resilient channels, insulation, or other sound-attenuating treatments.",

The 4-6 point improvement for STC is within commonly cited ranges, though some sources indicate improvements can be higher (up to 8 points) or lower (3-4 points) depending on the specific assembly. IIC improvements from insulation alone are typically more modest and variable. The claim is reasonable but the exact range depends heavily on the baseline assembly being modified.",
