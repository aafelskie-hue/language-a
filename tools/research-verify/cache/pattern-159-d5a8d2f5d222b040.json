The National Research Council of Canada and various acoustic testing laboratories have documented that unimproved wood-frame floors with simple drywall ceilings typically achieve STC values in the mid-30s and IIC values in the low-30s or below. The specific numbers STC 35 and IIC 32 represent typical baseline performance for this assembly type before any acoustic treatments are added.",
