      "detail": "P.O. Fanger was indeed a professor at the Technical University of Denmark and is widely recognized as a pioneer in thermal comfort research. His work from the 1960s-1970s established the PMV/PPD model that became the basis for ASHRAE and ISO standards. His research did address floor surface temperatures and local thermal discomfort, though the specific range of 19-26°C should be verified against his original publications such as 'Thermal Comfort' (1970). The timeframe beginning in the 1970s may slightly understate his work, as his foundational research began in the late 1960s.",

The COP is highly dependent on the temperature lift (difference between source and delivery temperature). Radiant floor systems operating at 35°C (95°F) represent a low-temperature application, which minimizes the temperature lift and maximizes COP. With ground temperatures typically 10-15°C and delivery at 35°C, the modest temperature lift of 20-25°C readily supports COP values of 4 or higher. This is consistent with data from DOE, ASHRAE, and manufacturer specifications.",
