      "summary": "The claim is directionally correct but oversimplified; the relationship between color temperature and melatonin suppression is more nuanced than a simple 2700K threshold.",
      "detail": "Research confirms that blue light (short wavelength, ~460-480nm) suppresses melatonin more than red/orange light. Lower color temperatures (like 2700K) contain less blue light and are generally better for evening use. However, melatonin suppression depends on multiple factors including light intensity (lux), duration of exposure, individual sensitivity, and prior light exposure history—not just color temperature alone. The 2700K threshold is a useful heuristic rather than a precise scientific cutoff. Some studies suggest even lower temperatures (1800-2200K) may be preferable for minimal melatonin suppression.",

While 4000K is indeed very common in commercial and office settings and could be called 'standard' in those contexts, there is no single universal standard. The characterization of 4000K as 'the' standard overstates its exclusivity. 3500K and 4100K are also extremely common in commercial applications.",
