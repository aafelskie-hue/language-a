      "detail": "The Halifax Regional Municipality did conduct a fiscal analysis around 2013 examining the costs of suburban vs urban development, and it found suburban development significantly more expensive per capita. The study is frequently cited in urban planning literature. However, I cannot verify the exact figures of $3,462 and $1,416 without web access. Some sources cite slightly different figures from this study, and the methodology examined net fiscal impact rather than pure 'cost' per capita. The core finding that suburban development costs more than double urban core development is consistent with the study's conclusions.",
