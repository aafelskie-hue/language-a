Within the 'outdoor spaces and buildings' domain, outdoor seating is mentioned as an important feature. However, the claim mischaracterizes these as 'eight essential features for age-friendly public spaces' when they are actually eight broad domains covering all aspects of city life.",

Standard seating research shows that lower seat heights require greater knee flexion angles and increased quadriceps force to rise, which becomes more challenging with age-related muscle weakness. The 40 cm height mentioned as 'standard bench' height is indeed typical for many public benches, and the 45-50 cm range corresponds to approximately 100-115% of knee height, which biomechanics literature supports as optimal for ease of rising. The ADA recommends seat heights of 17-19 inches (43-48 cm) for accessibility, which closely matches this claim.",
