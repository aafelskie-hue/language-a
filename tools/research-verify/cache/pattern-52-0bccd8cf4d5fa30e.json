However, the number varies across citations — some say 6 minutes, some say 13 minutes, some say 'less than 15 minutes.' The statistic is often traced to a statement by sustainability advocates or sharing economy proponents, but a peer-reviewed primary study establishing this figure has not been definitively identified. The claim is directionally correct (power drills are indeed rarely used) but the specific '13 minutes' figure should be treated as an approximation or illustrative estimate rather than a rigorously measured statistic.",
