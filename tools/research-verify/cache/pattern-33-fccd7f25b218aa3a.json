      "summary": "The study exists and core findings are accurate, but the claim about 'fewer complications' requires clarification.",
      "detail": "Roger Ulrich's 1984 study 'View through a window may influence recovery from surgery' was published in Science (Vol. 224, pp. 420-421). The study of cholecystectomy patients did find that those with tree views had shorter hospital stays, took fewer analgesics, and had fewer negative evaluative comments from nurses compared to those with brick wall views. However, the original study specifically measured 'negative evaluative comments in nurses' notes' rather than 'complications' in the clinical sense. The claim slightly overstates by using the term 'complications.'",
