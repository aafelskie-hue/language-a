      "summary": "Edward Hall's 'The Hidden Dimension' was published in 1966, but the book primarily discusses proxemics (human use of space) rather than commerce along linear paths.",
      "detail": "Edward Hall's 'The Hidden Dimension' was indeed published in 1966 and Hall was an anthropologist. However, the book is primarily about proxemics—the study of how humans perceive and use space in different cultures, including personal space, territorial behavior, and spatial relationships. While Hall discusses how humans organize and perceive space, the specific claim that he observed humans 'naturally cluster commerce along linear paths' appears to be an interpretation or extension rather than a core thesis of the book. The book focuses more on interpersonal distance and cross-cultural spatial perception than on commercial geography.",

      "detail": "Both pattern numbers and titles are accurate. Pattern 46 'Market of Many Shops' advocates for markets composed of many small, individually-owned shops rather than department stores. Pattern 87 'Individually Owned Shops' calls for shops where the owner works behind the counter and has a personal stake in the community. These are well-documented patterns from the 253-pattern system in Alexander's canonical architecture text.",
