      "summary": "ASHRAE 62.1 uses 5 cfm/person as a component of ventilation calculation, but not as a standalone 'minimum' - it combines this with an area-based rate.",
      "detail": "ASHRAE Standard 62.1 uses a Ventilation Rate Procedure that calculates outdoor air requirements using two components: a per-person rate (Rp) and a per-area rate (Ra). For office spaces, Rp is indeed 5 cfm/person, but this is added to Ra (typically 0.06 cfm/sq ft for offices). The claim that 5 cfm is the 'minimum' is an oversimplification - the actual minimum depends on space type and occupant density. The 5 cfm figure is accurate for the breathing zone outdoor airflow per person component in many occupancy categories.",
