      "detail": "The term 'mews' derives from the Royal Mews, where royal hawks were kept ('mewed'). In the Georgian era (roughly 1714-1830, spanning the 18th century), mews developed as back lanes behind wealthy terraced houses in areas like Belgravia and Mayfair, housing stables, coach houses, and servants' quarters. The 17th century date may be slightly early for widespread development, as most mews architecture dates from the 18th-19th centuries, but the practice did begin emerging in the late 1600s.

The pattern discusses height-to-width ratios for enclosure, but Alexander typically references ratios in terms of how surrounding building heights relate to the width of outdoor spaces. The commonly cited threshold from Alexander's work is that the height of surrounding walls should be at least half the width of the space, or a relationship where D/H (distance to height) should not exceed 2:1.
