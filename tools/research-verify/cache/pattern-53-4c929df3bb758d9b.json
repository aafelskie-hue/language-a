      "summary": "The math is correct (5+5=10), but calling five-foot setbacks 'standard' is imprecise since setback requirements vary by jurisdiction.",
      "detail": "The arithmetic is sound: two adjacent 5-foot side setbacks create a 10-foot gap between buildings. Five-foot side setbacks are indeed common in many U.S. residential zoning codes, though they are not universal. Some jurisdictions require 3-foot minimums, others require 10+ feet, and commercial/industrial zones often differ. The claim is practically accurate for illustrating how setbacks create unused space, even if 'standard' oversimplifies jurisdictional variation.",
