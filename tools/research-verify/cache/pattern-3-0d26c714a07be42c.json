Residential streets and minor roads typically require 5-20 lux average horizontal illuminance, while collector roads may require 10-30 lux. The claimed range of 15-25 lux falls squarely within typical street lighting specifications for standard residential and secondary roadways. Major arterials and highways may exceed this range (30-50+ lux), but the claim's characterization of 'standard' street lighting is accurate for most residential contexts.",

However, the commonly cited '80%' figure specifically refers to the percentage who cannot see the Milky Way from where they live, not who cannot see the 'natural night sky' entirely. These are related but distinct claims - some light pollution affects nearly everyone, but complete loss of Milky Way visibility affects about 80% globally (and over 99% in the US and Europe). The claim as stated is a reasonable approximation.",

Pollinating insects like moths are attracted to artificial lights, disrupting pollination patterns and causing exhaustion and death.

These effects are documented across multiple peer-reviewed journals and wildlife agency reports.",
