      "detail": "The claim is technically accurate. While sodium chloride's theoretical eutectic point is -21°C, in practical road maintenance applications, rock salt becomes ineffective at temperatures below approximately -15°C to -18°C because the rate of ice melting becomes too slow to be useful. Transportation departments commonly switch to alternative deicers like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride below these temperatures. This is well-documented in winter maintenance literature from transportation agencies.",

The system began in 1988, which is consistent with 'since the 1980s'. However, the coverage area has expanded significantly over time and is often cited as covering more than five blocks - some sources cite approximately 190,000 square feet or varying block counts. The core claim about the existence, timing, and waste heat source is accurate, but the 'approximately five blocks' figure may be outdated or imprecise.",
