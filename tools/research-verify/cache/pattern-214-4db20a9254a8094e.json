The 20-meter figure for regular streets is accurate, and building heights of 6-7 stories (approximately 18-24 meters) do create roughly a 1:1 height-to-width ratio on these streets.

Buildings were typically limited to 20 meters on streets at least 20 meters wide, with additional restrictions on roof height and a 45-degree angle requirement for setbacks above the cornice line. The phrase 'street width plus a cornice setback' oversimplifies the actual regulation, which involved specific maximum heights based on street width categories rather than a simple additive formula.",
