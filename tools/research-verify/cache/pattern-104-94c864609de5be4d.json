      "detail": "Vinyl siding does indeed have pigment integrated throughout the material (unlike painted surfaces where color is only on the surface) — this is a well-documented manufacturing characteristic. However, the claim that fading is 'irreversible' is an overstatement. While UV degradation does cause permanent molecular changes to the pigments, vinyl siding can be restored through painting or specialty vinyl-safe coatings, meaning the color loss is not truly irreversible from a practical standpoint. The fading itself (photodegradation) is a one-way chemical process, but the aesthetic result can be remediated.",
