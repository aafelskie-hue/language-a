      "confidence": 0.85,
      "summary": "The claim that external shading can reject up to 80% of solar heat gain is consistent with established building science and manufacturer specifications.",
      "detail": "External shading devices (awnings, louvers, overhangs, exterior blinds) are widely documented in building energy literature as being significantly more effective than interior shading because they intercept solar radiation before it passes through the glass. The 80% figure is commonly cited by organizations like the U.S. Department of Energy, ASHRAE, and window attachment manufacturers. The DOE's Energy Saver guide notes that exterior shading can reduce solar heat gain by 65-80% depending on the device type and installation. This is because external shades prevent the greenhouse effect that occurs when radiation passes through glass and is re-emitted as heat inside.",

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "summary": "The claim is directionally correct but the specific range of 40-50% may be slightly conservative for some high-performance reflective blinds.",
      "detail": "Technical literature generally supports that internal shading is less effective than external shading because solar radiation has already passed through the glass and converted to heat inside the building envelope. However, highly reflective internal blinds (with reflectivity above 80%) can achieve solar heat gain coefficients (SHGC) reductions of up to 55-60% in some configurations, slightly higher than the 40-50% claimed. The underlying physics explanation in the claim is accurate: internal shading can only reflect radiation back out through the glass, while absorbed energy heats the room. Without web search access, I cannot verify current technical specifications from authoritative sources.",
