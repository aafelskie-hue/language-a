      "detail": "The claim that primary care addresses approximately 80-90% of healthcare needs is commonly cited in healthcare policy literature and by organizations like the World Health Organization and American Academy of Family Physicians. However, the exact percentage varies depending on whether it refers to visits, conditions treated, or healthcare interactions. Some sources cite figures ranging from 75-90%. The specific 80% figure is a reasonable approximation within commonly cited ranges, though it should ideally include a source attribution.",
