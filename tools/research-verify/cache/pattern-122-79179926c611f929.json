      "summary": "The calculation is plausible but requires assumptions about room volume that are not specified in the claim.",
      "detail": "Using standard cross-ventilation formulas (Q = Cv × A × v with Cv ≈ 0.5), two 0.5 m² openings at 5 m/s would deliver approximately 1.25 m³/s or 4,500 m³/h. This yields 15-25 ACH for rooms of 180-300 m³, which matches the claim. However, the claim omits the critical room volume parameter — ACH is dependent on room size. The 15-25 range is achievable but only for specific room volumes, making this technically incomplete rather than wrong.",
