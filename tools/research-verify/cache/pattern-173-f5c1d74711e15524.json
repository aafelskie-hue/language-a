While 30\" and 32\" are indeed common sizes, particularly for bedroom and bathroom doors, the claim oversimplifies by not acknowledging that 28\" is also very common for bathrooms and closets, and 36\" is standard for entry/main doors and accessibility requirements. The International Residential Code requires minimum 32\" clear width for at least one exterior door.",

The ADA requires 32 inches minimum clear opening, which is why accessible doors are typically 36 inches nominal. The claimed range of 27-29 inches for 30-32 inch doors aligns with these construction standards.",
