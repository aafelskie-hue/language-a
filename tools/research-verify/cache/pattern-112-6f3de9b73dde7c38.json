      "summary": "Fez was founded in 789 CE and its medina contains courtyard houses that have been continuously inhabited since the medieval period, supporting the approximately 1,000-year claim.",
      "detail": "Fez el-Bali (Old Fez) was founded by Idris I in 789 CE and expanded significantly under the Almoravids and Almohads in the 11th-12th centuries. The medina is recognized by UNESCO as one of the world's largest car-free urban areas and contains traditional courtyard houses (riads) that have been continuously occupied for centuries. While some specific houses may be 800-1000+ years old, the continuous habitation claim for approximately 1,000 years is historically accurate for the medina as a whole.",

      "summary": "Siheyuan compounds have existed for many centuries and housed multigenerational families, but 'twenty generations' is a specific claim that may be approximately correct for the oldest continuously occupied compounds.",
      "detail": "Siheyuan courtyard houses in Beijing date back to at least the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), with many constructed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). If a generation is approximately 25-30 years, twenty generations would span 500-600 years, which aligns with the older Ming and early Qing era compounds. However, many siheyuan were destroyed or repurposed during the 20th century, and continuous family occupation for twenty generations would be exceptional rather than typical. The claim is plausible for the oldest preserved compounds but cannot be verified without web access to primary sources.",
