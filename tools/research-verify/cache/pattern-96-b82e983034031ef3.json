The name itself translates to 'four-sided enclosed courtyard' - 'si' (四) means four, 'he' (合) means to surround/enclose, and 'yuan' (院) means courtyard. This housing typology features buildings arranged on all four sides of a central courtyard, which has been a fundamental Chinese residential design for over 2,000 years, particularly prominent in Beijing and northern China.",

This form developed from Roman and Moorish influences in the Iberian Peninsula, particularly prominent in Andalusia. The courtyard serves as the private outdoor heart of the home, with rooms arranged around it. This is widely documented in architectural history texts and is consistent with the claim's broader context listing other courtyard housing types across cultures.",

      "detail": "Bofællesskab is the Danish word for cohousing, a collaborative housing model that originated in Denmark in the 1960s. While many cohousing communities do feature shared outdoor spaces and some have courtyard-like arrangements, the defining characteristic is shared common facilities and intentional community, not specifically a courtyard layout. The claim conflates bofællesskab with courtyard architecture when it's actually a social housing model that can take various physical forms including row houses, clusters, and yes, sometimes courtyards.",
