Two spaces would require 24-30 square meters minimum. A two-car garage typically measures 5.5-6.0 meters wide by 5.5-6.0 meters deep (30-36 square meters). Adding driveway apron space (approximately 5-15 square meters for maneuvering), the 30-50 square meter range is consistent with standard residential parking provisions.
