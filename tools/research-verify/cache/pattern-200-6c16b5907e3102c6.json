      "detail": "Both species strongly prefer fishless temporary/vernal pools for breeding because fish predation on eggs and larvae drastically reduces reproductive success. However, 'exclusively' is too strong. Wood frogs and spotted salamanders have been documented breeding in semi-permanent pools, beaver ponds, and occasionally even permanent water bodies when fish are absent or in low densities. The biological preference is for fishless waters (temporary or permanent), not strictly temporary pools. Additionally, the original text contains a spelling error: 'Amblyostoma' should be 'Ambystoma'.",
