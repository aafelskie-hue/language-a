      "detail": "Heat pump efficiency is measured by Coefficient of Performance (COP), which represents heat output divided by electrical input. Modern air-source heat pumps typically have COPs ranging from 2.5 to 4.0 under moderate conditions, meaning they deliver 2.5-4 units of heat per unit of electricity. Ground-source (geothermal) heat pumps can achieve COPs of 3-5. The U.S. Department of Energy and EPA ENERGY STAR program confirm these efficiency ranges. The claim's 2-4 range is accurate and commonly cited in technical literature.",
