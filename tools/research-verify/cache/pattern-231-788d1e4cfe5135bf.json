      "summary": "The stated reflectance values of 0.80 for white walls and 0.20 for charcoal walls align with standard Light Reflectance Value (LRV) ranges documented in paint industry and lighting design references.",
      "detail": "Light Reflectance Value (LRV) is a standard measure in the paint and lighting industries. White paints typically have LRV values ranging from 0.75-0.90, with many pure whites around 0.80-0.85. Dark charcoal or near-black colors typically range from 0.05-0.25, with charcoal gray commonly around 0.15-0.25. The claim's values of 0.80 and 0.20 fall squarely within these established ranges. The 4:1 ratio calculation (0.80/0.20 = 4) is mathematically correct.",

This translates accurately to 'luminosity' or 'brightness' in English. Could not access online dictionaries for direct confirmation, but the morphological derivation is consistent with standard Finnish word formation.",
