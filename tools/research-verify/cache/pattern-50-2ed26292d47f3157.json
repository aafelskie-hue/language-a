      "detail": "Research from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and academic economists has documented that land constitutes a substantial majority of residential property value in many metropolitan areas. Studies show that in expensive coastal cities like San Francisco, Vancouver, and New York, land can account for 70-85% of property value, while in mid-tier cities it often ranges from 50-70%. The Federal Reserve and various housing economists have also noted this trend, particularly as land values have appreciated faster than construction costs over recent decades.",
