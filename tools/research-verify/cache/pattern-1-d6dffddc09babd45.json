However, his work is primarily conceptual and advocacy-based rather than empirical research that 'demonstrated' measurable outcomes. The claimed benefits (social cohesion, lower emissions, stronger local economies) are theoretical benefits he proposes rather than findings from controlled studies he conducted. Without web search access, I cannot verify if he has published specific empirical studies with these measured outcomes.",
