The claim of 'approximately 10 lux' as a trigger for melatonin production onset is not a well-established threshold in the scientific literature I'm aware of. Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) protocols typically use <30 lux or <10 lux as 'dim' conditions, but this describes research methodology rather than a biological threshold.",
