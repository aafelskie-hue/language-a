      "detail": "The Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is a legitimate research institution that has extensively studied the effects of light on circadian rhythms and melatonin. They have documented that evening light exposure suppresses melatonin. However, the specific claim of '100 lux' as the threshold and '30-60 minutes' delay requires source verification. Research in this field typically shows melatonin suppression begins at lower light levels and the relationship is complex, involving light spectrum (particularly blue light) and duration, not just intensity alone. Without web access, I cannot confirm the exact figures cited.",
