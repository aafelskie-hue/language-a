      "detail": "The claim that Montreal's triplex form dates to the 1850s could not be independently verified because web search tools were not available. Based on general knowledge, Montreal's distinctive plex housing with exterior iron stairs is typically associated with the late 19th century urban expansion, roughly 1870s-1920s. The 1850s date may be slightly early, but architectural historians would need to be consulted for precise dating. Without access to primary sources or academic architectural history, this remains unverified.",
