  "notes": "Unable to verify evidence - web search permissions not granted. However, this pattern concept has strong conceptual grounding: (1) The WELL Building Standard v2 does include circadian lighting requirements, though specific window orientation mandates would need verification. (2) Research on circadian rhythms and light exposure is extensive (e.g., work by researchers like Mariana Figueiro at the Lighting Research Center), but specific studies linking dual east-west window orientation to sleep outcomes would need to be searched and verified. (3) The specific claim of 'circadian windows' with both east and west exposure as a named pattern may be novel rather than established practice. To properly research this pattern, please grant web search permissions."
