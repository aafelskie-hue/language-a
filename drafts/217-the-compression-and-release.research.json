      "year": "2007",
      "finding": "Higher ceilings promoted abstract, relational processing while lower ceilings promoted detail-oriented processing. Published in Journal of Consumer Research. This study is foundational for understanding how ceiling height affects cognition, though it examines absolute height rather than sequential compression-release."

  "notes": "IMPORTANT CAVEAT: I was unable to perform web searches to verify current sources. The compression-release principle is well-established in architectural theory and practice, particularly associated with Frank Lloyd Wright's work, but I cannot provide properly sourced citations without web access. The Meyers-Levy study on ceiling height is real but addresses absolute height rather than sequential contrast. The built examples are real places where this principle is demonstrated, but I cannot provide URLs or verify specific outcomes. This research should be repeated with web search enabled to gather properly sourced evidence. The pattern itself is architecturally sound but formal academic studies specifically on compression-release sequences (rather than absolute ceiling heights) may be limited."
