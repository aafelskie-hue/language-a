# 210. The Biophilic Material Palette [★]

**…beyond Nature in Every Room (30), Living Surfaces (47), and Honest Materials (56)…**

**When buildings are finished entirely in synthetic materials — vinyl, plastic laminate, painted drywall, acrylic stone — they sever the ancient connection between human hands and the materials of the earth. The surfaces are smooth but not alive. They can be touched but do not respond. The building becomes a sealed container, and its occupants, though sheltered, grow imperceptibly restless in a world without grain, without weight, without the slow pulse of matter that was once alive.**

The evidence that natural materials affect human physiology is now substantial. Fell (2010) studied stress recovery in rooms with and without wood interiors and found that physiological recovery — measured through heart rate variability and blood pressure — was faster in wood-finished rooms. Tsunetsugu, Miyazaki, and Sato (2007) refined this further: moderate wood coverage (approximately 45% of visible surfaces) produced optimal physiological responses. Both no wood and excessive wood coverage were less beneficial. The body, it seems, seeks balance — enough natural material to feel grounded, not so much that it overwhelms.

The broader pattern holds across cultures and building types. The Human Spaces Report (2015), a global study of 7,600 office workers by Interface and Terrapin Bright Green, found that workers in environments with natural elements — including visible wood — reported 15% higher wellbeing scores than those in environments without. Nyrud and Bringslimark's 2010 review of psychological responses to wood found consistent evidence that wood interiors evoke positive emotional responses, perceived warmth, and a sense of naturalness that synthetic imitations do not achieve. The effect is not merely aesthetic. It is physiological, measurable, and reproducible.

This understanding has begun to shape policy. British Columbia's Wood First Act (2009) mandated wood as the primary structural material in publicly funded buildings, leading to projects like Brock Commons Tallwood House at UBC — an 18-story mass timber residence where exposed wood in common areas was deliberately preserved for biophilic benefit. France's RE2020 regulations (2022) require 50% bio-based materials in new public buildings by 2030. The Maggie's Centre in Leeds uses extensive exposed timber structure to create a calming environment for cancer patients. The Bullitt Center in Seattle specifies FSC-certified wood as part of its Living Building Challenge compliance, treating material provenance as a health issue.

Alexander recognized this in Pattern 207 (Good Materials), where he wrote that buildings should be made of materials "which are natural, soft, and have weight" — materials that weather, that show their age, that can be touched without revulsion. But Alexander did not specify a palette or offer criteria for selection. This pattern does.

The palette is not arbitrary. It includes four families: wood (structural timber, millwork, plywood with visible grain), stone (limestone, granite, slate, river rock), earth (clay plaster, brick, tile, terrazzo with natural aggregate), and fiber (wool, cotton, linen, sisal, cork). What unites them is this: each was once alive or was formed by geological time. Each has texture that varies at multiple scales. Each can be touched, and the touch is answered — warmth from wood, coolness from stone, softness from fiber, the slight roughness of lime plaster under the hand.

**Therefore: in every building, select a biophilic material palette of three to five natural materials — at least one from wood, one from stone or earth, and one from fiber — and use them on surfaces people touch and see daily. Apply the 45% rule: natural materials should cover roughly 45% of visible interior surfaces, neither less nor more. The test: stand in the room and count the materials your hand could touch within arm's reach. If fewer than two are natural, the room is starved. If all surfaces are wood, the room is drowned. Balance is the goal — enough to ground, not so much to overwhelm.**
