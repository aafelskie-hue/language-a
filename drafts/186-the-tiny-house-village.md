# 186. The Tiny House Village [★]

**…beyond House Cluster (Alexander 37)…**

**When minimum dwelling sizes are mandated at 30 or 40 square meters, the most affordable housing form — the tiny dwelling of 10 to 25 square meters — becomes illegal, and people who could afford a very small heated room with a locking door instead sleep outside, in shelters, or in dangerous informal arrangements. Yet the mandate exists because isolated tiny dwellings, each struggling to provide kitchen, bathroom, heat, and social space within fifteen square meters, produce miserable living conditions. The tension: a tiny dwelling alone is inadequate, but a tiny dwelling made illegal leaves people with nothing at all.**

The arithmetic of housing cost is brutal and linear: a dwelling half the size costs roughly half as much to build, heat, and maintain. At Edmonton's construction costs of $2,500–$3,500 per square meter, a 15-square-meter insulated unit costs $37,000–$52,000 to build — a fraction of even the most modest conventional housing. For someone earning $18,000 a year on provincial disability support, a $400/month housing cost is survivable; a $1,200/month market rent is not. The tiny dwelling fills a price point that no other housing form can reach.

Community First! Village in Austin, Texas, demonstrates the model at scale: over 500 micro-homes of 10 to 40 square meters, clustered around shared bathhouses, community kitchens, and common gathering spaces. Residents pay $225–$430 per month. The village reports 85% housing retention over five years — far exceeding typical shelter outcomes. The critical insight: what makes tiny dwellings livable is not making them larger, but clustering them around generous shared amenities. Each dwelling provides only what must be private — sleeping, personal belongings, a door that locks. Everything else is shared and therefore better than any tiny dwelling could provide alone.

Cold climate changes the calculus but does not break it. A 15-square-meter insulated unit with a single 1500W electric heater maintains 20°C when it is -30°C outside, if the envelope achieves R-40 walls and R-60 roof — tight, well-insulated, and small. Edmonton's Ambrose Place, a permanent supportive housing project, uses small private rooms (under 25 square meters) with shared kitchens and common areas; residents report the private space feels adequate because the common space is generous. The danger in cold climate is not the small dwelling itself but the isolation: a person in a tiny unit with no common room, no community kitchen, no social infrastructure will suffer. A person in that same unit, with a heated common house thirty meters away, will thrive.

The shared amenities are not optional extras — they are what makes the tiny dwelling humane. A community kitchen (94) where residents can cook a real meal when their unit has only a microwave. Shared laundry (93) with commercial machines that actually dry winter parkas. Common storage (95) for the seasonal gear that would otherwise consume the entire dwelling. A heated common house where people can sit, read, meet neighbors, warm up after walking home in February. Without these, the tiny dwelling is a cage. With them, it is a village.

**Therefore: cluster eight to twenty tiny dwellings — each 12 to 25 square meters, with sleeping space, personal storage, and a door that locks — around a heated common house of at least 60 square meters containing a community kitchen, shared laundry, and social space. Place the common house so that no dwelling entrance is more than 40 meters away, and the path is cleared of snow in winter. Provide shared bathhouses if dwellings lack private bathrooms — one toilet and one shower per four units, in a heated structure within 25 meters of every dwelling served. Arrange dwellings to form a pocket neighborhood (111) with front doors facing a shared commons. The village passes the test if a resident can walk from their bed to the common house kitchen, in pajamas, in February, in under ninety seconds.**
