To provide accurate, verifiable citations for this pattern about sump pump battery backup systems, I would need to search for: (1) insurance industry data on basement flooding claims during power outages, (2) building code requirements in flood-prone municipalities, (3) FEMA or similar agency reports on residential flood damage, (4) academic studies on sump pump reliability and backup systems. Without search capability, I cannot fabricate citations. Please enable web search and retry, or provide source documents for me to analyze."
