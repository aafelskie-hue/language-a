# 187. The Flood-Ready Neighborhood [☆]

**…this pattern helps shape Alexander's COMMUNITY OF 7,000 (12) and IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD (14), and provides context for LOCAL TOWN HALL (44)…**

**When a river floods — as rivers do — neighborhoods built on the floodplain face an impossible choice: absorb catastrophic damage to homes and infrastructure, or abandon places where people have built lives, memories, and community. The same water that makes riverbanks beautiful makes them dangerous, and conventional development treats this danger as something to be walled out rather than accommodated.**

The Dutch, who have more experience with flooding than almost anyone, changed their approach after the near-catastrophe of 1995, when 250,000 people evacuated from rising rivers. Their *Room for the River* program, completed in 2018, didn't build higher dikes. Instead, it gave water places to go: 34 projects that lowered floodplains, created bypasses, relocated dikes inland, and designated areas that would flood intentionally so that others wouldn't. The Noordwaard polder, for instance, was redesigned to flood regularly — its farms built on elevated mounds, its roads designed to go underwater, its residents compensated and prepared. The water comes, spreads, and recedes. Life continues.

In the United States, FEMA has funded property buyouts in flood-prone areas since 1989. The acquired land becomes permanent open space — no future development, no future damage. Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, has run one of the largest buyout programs in the country. After Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the county purchased thousands of homes in repeatedly flooded areas, converting subdivisions into detention basins and wetlands. The Edgebrook neighborhood, flooded six times in fourteen years, became Edgebrook Park. Families relocated. The water now has somewhere to go.

What both approaches share is acceptance: flooding will happen, and the question is not whether to prevent it — you cannot — but how to arrange land and buildings so that floods cause inconvenience rather than catastrophe. This means some areas become flood storage, absorbing water intentionally. Other areas, where people live, sit higher — on natural ridges, constructed mounds, or elevated foundations. Streets and parks serve double duty, becoming temporary channels and detention during storms. Nothing precious sits at the bottom.

Alexander's original language said little about flooding, though his patterns for WATER (25) and STILL WATER (71) recognized water's pull on human settlement. The attraction is real: people want to live near rivers, and they always have. The pattern here is not to forbid it, but to arrange the settlement so the relationship is honest — water will enter, and the neighborhood will survive it.

**Therefore: design flood-prone neighborhoods with three distinct zones. First, designate lowest-lying areas — those within the 100-year floodplain — as flood storage: parks, sports fields, community gardens, and wetlands that accept water during floods and recover afterward. Second, place all residential and commercial buildings on ground at least one meter above the 100-year flood level, whether through natural topography, engineered mounds, or elevated construction. Third, design streets, pathways, and utilities to function as temporary drainage, with infrastructure protected or accessible for quick restoration. Test by modeling: when the 100-year flood arrives, no occupied building should flood above floor level, and 90% of neighborhood function should return within 72 hours of water receding.**
