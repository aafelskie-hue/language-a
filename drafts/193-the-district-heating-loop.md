# 193. The District Heating Loop [★]

**…beyond Neighborhood Energy Commons (21) and The Winter City Street (58)…**

**When every building burns its own fuel, each furnace sits idle most of the year, renewable heat sources remain impractical at small scale, and the neighborhood misses the chance to capture waste heat that rises from servers, sewers, and industry — heat that dissipates into cold air while natural gas flows into every basement.**

The arithmetic of heating favors the collective. A single household furnace runs at 80-95% efficiency but operates in isolation — it cannot use the waste heat from the arena's ice plant, the data center's servers, or the bakery's ovens. District heating systems capture these otherwise-lost calories. Copenhagen's district heating network, serving 99% of the city, operates at an effective efficiency exceeding 90% while drawing 65% of its heat from waste sources: garbage incineration, industrial processes, and power plant exhaust. The system has reduced Copenhagen's CO₂ emissions by 665,000 tonnes annually.

In cold climates, the economics improve further. Edmonton's 5,200 heating degree days (base 18°C) mean furnaces run hard from October through April. The University of Alberta's district energy system, serving 90 buildings across campus, demonstrates the principle at scale: a central plant with thermal storage handles peak loads that would otherwise require oversized equipment in every building. When the university added cogeneration in 2010, it captured waste heat from electricity generation, improving overall fuel utilization to over 70% — heat that individual boilers would have sent up individual chimneys.

The Scandinavian model proves the pattern at neighborhood scale. Västerås, Sweden (population 120,000, latitude 59°N, winters comparable to Edmonton) converted to district heating beginning in 1954. By 2020, the system served 98% of buildings, with water temperatures of 70-120°C flowing through 400 kilometers of insulated pipe. Heat losses in modern pre-insulated pipes run 5-10% annually — less than the efficiency gap between an aging basement furnace and a centralized plant with professional maintenance. The Swedish experience shows district heating works best when established during neighborhood construction or major infrastructure renewal, when streets are already open and building mechanical systems are being specified.

The critical constraint is density. District heating requires enough buildings, close enough together, to justify the buried infrastructure. Danish guidelines suggest a minimum heat density of 1.5 GJ per linear meter of trench per year — roughly 25-30 dwellings per hectare, or the density of rowhouses and low-rise apartments. Below this threshold, pipe losses exceed the efficiency gains. Edmonton's mature neighborhoods — Strathcona, Garneau, Oliver — meet this density; sprawling suburbs do not.

**Therefore: when building or renewing a neighborhood of twenty-five or more dwellings per hectare, install a district heating loop — insulated pipes carrying hot water from a central plant to heat exchangers in each building. Site the energy center where waste heat is available: adjacent to an ice arena, data center, commercial kitchen, or sewage trunk line. Size the plant for base load and use building-scale heat pumps (194) to handle peaks. Bury supply and return pipes in a shared trench with other utilities, insulated to limit losses below 10%. The test: measure annual heat delivery against fuel input — the system should achieve 85% or better overall efficiency, counting distribution losses.**

**…this pattern connects to Passive Solar Design (126), which reduces each building's heating demand, and The Heat Pump System (194), which provides efficient backup and peak capacity…**
