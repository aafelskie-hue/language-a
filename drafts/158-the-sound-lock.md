# 158. The Sound Lock [★]

**…beyond SOUND GRADIENT (90) and THE QUIET ZONE (9)…**

**A single wall, no matter how massive, transmits sound through its structure — the bass note travels through the stud, the impact rings through the joist. You can add mass, add absorption, add resilient channels, but the wall remains a bridge. The same is true of a single door: even a solid-core door with perfect gaskets passes sound through its surface whenever someone speaks on the other side. To create true silence, you need not a better barrier but a gap — an acoustic no-man's-land where sound dies before reaching the other side.**

The principle is ancient. Medieval churches placed vestibules between the noisy street and the sanctuary. Recording studios have used double-door airlocks since the 1930s. The physics is straightforward: sound travels through solid materials more efficiently than through air, so any continuous structural connection between two spaces becomes a sound bridge. Breaking that connection — with an air gap, a second decoupled surface, or both — forces sound to make a double crossing, losing energy each time.

The Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating system quantifies this. A standard interior wall — single layer of 5/8" drywall on each side of wood studs — achieves roughly STC 33. Double the drywall on each side and you reach STC 40. But build a double wall — two separate stud rows with an air gap between them, each side independently finished — and you reach STC 55 or higher. The gap matters more than the mass. The same principle applies to doors: two STC-30 doors with a vestibule between them outperform a single STC-45 door, because the air volume between them absorbs and dissipates sound energy.

Alexander understood the need for acoustic gradients (see his pattern INTIMACY GRADIENT, Alexander 127), but he wrote before the worst of modern noise intrusion — the open-plan office, the home with television in every room, the neighbor's subwoofer through the shared wall. His patterns suggest zoning and placement; this pattern provides the construction detail that makes the zoning work. Where SOUND GRADIENT (90) arranges rooms from lively to quiet, The Sound Lock provides the physical mechanism at the threshold.

The construction is not complex. For walls: build two independent stud frames with at least 1" of air gap between them, insulated with mineral wool in each cavity, finished with staggered-seam drywall. No electrical boxes back-to-back; no pipes bridging the gap. For doors: create a vestibule — even 24" deep is sufficient — with solid-core doors at both ends, each gasketed at jambs and threshold. The vestibule walls should be absorptive (fabric-wrapped panels, heavy curtain) to dampen whatever sound enters the lock. The key is discontinuity: the two surfaces must share no structural path.

**Therefore: wherever a quiet space adjoins a noisy one — bedroom beside living room, study beside playroom, sleeping loft above music room — construct a sound lock. For walls, build double-stud construction with a minimum 1" air gap, each cavity insulated independently, no penetrations bridging the gap. For doorways, create a vestibule at least 18" deep with solid-core doors at both ends, gasketed on all edges, the vestibule lined with absorptive material. Test the construction by playing music at 85 dB(A) on the loud side; with the sound lock closed, measure no more than 30 dB(A) on the quiet side — a reduction of at least 55 dB.**
