# 236. The Greywater Wetland [★]

**…beyond The Bioswale Network (119) and Neighborhood Energy Commons (21)…**

**When each building must treat its own greywater, the economics rarely work. A household produces 150–200 liters of greywater daily — enough to justify treatment and reuse — but the constructed wetland or biofilter needed to treat it requires land, maintenance expertise, and regulatory approval that most single lots cannot provide. Meanwhile, the collective greywater from twenty or forty households — thousands of liters daily — could support a properly-sized wetland with professional oversight. The water exists; the treatment capacity exists; but the scale mismatch keeps them apart.**

Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment are among the most thoroughly documented natural treatment technologies. The EPA's 2000 manual on constructed wetlands for municipal wastewater established the foundational sizing: subsurface flow wetlands require approximately 5–10 square meters of treatment area per person equivalent, depending on climate and treatment goals. For a neighborhood of 100 residents producing greywater (excluding toilet waste), this means 500–1,000 square meters of wetland — roughly the footprint of a tennis court or small park.

The Arcata Marsh in Humboldt County, California, demonstrated at civic scale what works at neighborhood scale: constructed wetlands integrated into public space, treating wastewater while providing habitat and recreation. Operating since 1986, the system treats the city's entire wastewater flow through 154 acres of oxidation ponds and constructed marshes. The principle scales down: Findhorn Ecovillage in Scotland operates a Living Machine treating greywater from multiple buildings, integrating treatment cells into the community's public landscape. Austria's requirement for on-site wastewater treatment in areas without sewers produced dozens of shared wetland systems serving clusters of rural homes.

Greywater — the relatively clean water from showers, sinks, and laundry — is far easier to treat than blackwater. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids drop by 90% or more in a properly designed subsurface flow wetland with 3–5 days retention time. The treated effluent meets standards for landscape irrigation in most jurisdictions, closing the loop that Greywater Loop (65) opens at the building scale. The critical insight is that shared treatment, like shared energy infrastructure, creates both efficiency and visibility — the wetland becomes a legible part of the neighborhood, a place where water visibly flows, pools, and emerges cleaner.

The barrier is not technical but organizational. Greywater from multiple buildings requires: separated plumbing in each building (the pre-plumbing that Greywater Loop prescribes), a collection network to the shared wetland, land for the treatment cells, and a governance structure for maintenance. The last requirement echoes Neighborhood Energy Commons (21) — shared infrastructure demands shared stewardship. Where these elements align, the economics reverse: the per-household cost of shared treatment drops to a fraction of individual systems, and the wetland achieves the biological diversity and process stability that small single-lot systems cannot sustain.

**Therefore: where twenty or more households share a neighborhood, establish a constructed wetland commons to receive greywater from all participating buildings. Size the wetland at 7 square meters per person served, with subsurface horizontal flow through gravel beds planted with Phragmites, Typha, or regionally appropriate emergent species. Locate the wetland where it can be seen from paths and gathering spaces — not hidden behind fences. Route treated effluent to subsurface irrigation for shared landscapes or to holding tanks for toilet flushing in community buildings. The test: sample the influent and effluent monthly; BOD reduction should exceed 85% and the effluent should be visibly clear.**
