  "notes": "Unable to gather evidence - web search and fetch permissions not granted. This pattern topic (school adaptive reuse) likely has substantial real-world evidence available, but I cannot verify or cite sources without search capabilities. Known examples exist in cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia where school closures have led to conversions, but specific citations would require web access to confirm details, dates, and outcomes. Recommend re-running this research task with web search enabled."
