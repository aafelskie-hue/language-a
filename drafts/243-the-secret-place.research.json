  "notes": "Unable to complete research - web search and web fetch permissions were not granted. Without access to search tools, I cannot verify real programs, statistics, studies, or built examples for this pattern. The concept of 'secret places' for children is discussed in Christopher Alexander's original Pattern Language (Pattern 203), and there is likely substantial research in environmental psychology and child development about children's need for private spaces, but I cannot cite specific sources without the ability to search and verify them. This research task should be re-run with web search permissions enabled."
