While I have general knowledge that seed libraries exist in public libraries across North America (such as the Richmond Grows Seed Lending Library in California, one of the first established around 2010, and Seeds of Diversity in Canada), I cannot provide specific statistics, outcomes, or citations without being able to verify them through current web searches. Please grant WebSearch permission and retry this research request."
