# 149. The Snow Storage Landscape [☆]

**…beyond Snow as Resource (60), The Winter City Street (58), The Local Street (43), and Green Corridors (44)…**

**When snow must be cleared from streets, parking lots, and walkways, it has to go somewhere — but wherever it goes creates problems. Pile it on lawns and it crushes shrubs, compacts soil, and delivers a slug of salt that kills vegetation. Pile it at intersections and it blocks sightlines for drivers and pedestrians. Pile it in parking lots and it consumes spaces needed for cars. Pile it anywhere without grading and it melts in April as a flood that overwhelms storm drains, ponds in basements, and washes pollutants untreated into rivers. The snow must be moved, but every expedient solution damages something else.**

Edmonton clears approximately 10,000 lane-kilometers of roads after major snow events. The City's 2023 Snow and Ice Control Policy identifies "snow storage" as a key design consideration for new developments, yet most neighborhoods built before 2010 have no designated storage — plows push snow onto boulevards, into intersection corners, and against fences, wherever there is space. The consequences compound: the City's Urban Forest Management Plan documents repeated shrub mortality along collector roads where plow operators have no alternative to burying vegetation. Traffic engineers report that snow piles at corners reduce pedestrian visibility to below the 2.4-meter sightline triangle required by Transportation Association of Canada guidelines. And Public Works data shows that spring melt events generate peak flows in the storm system that exceed design capacity, contributing to combined sewer overflows in older neighborhoods.

The problem is not the snow — it is the absence of a designed place for the snow to go. Nordic cities treat snow storage as infrastructure. Trondheim, Norway, designates "snødeponi" zones in every neighborhood — graded depressions, typically 50 to 200 square meters, located downslope from cleared areas and planted with salt-tolerant willows and sedges. These zones receive plowed snow throughout winter and release meltwater slowly in spring through graded overflow channels that connect to the municipal bioswale network. The vegetation filters sediment and pollutants; the grading prevents ponding against foundations. Helsinki's 2019 snow management plan requires all new developments over 1,000 square meters of impervious surface to demonstrate on-site snow storage capacity equal to 150 millimeters of snow water equivalent — roughly a 40-centimeter snowfall — before any off-site hauling is permitted.

The principle translates directly to Edmonton's conditions. A single 20-centimeter snowfall on a 500-square-meter parking lot produces roughly 10 cubic meters of snow. Without designated storage, this volume gets pushed to the edges, burying whatever is there. With a designed snow storage landscape — a depressed, planted zone along the lot's edge, sized at 15 percent of the cleared area and graded to overflow into the bioswale network — the same snow settles into a space built to receive it. The vegetation survives because it was chosen for burial: willows, dogwoods, native grasses that bend rather than break. The soil survives because the zone is graded for drainage, not ponding. The meltwater survives as a resource because it flows to infiltration rather than storm drains.

**Therefore: in every neighborhood, designate snow storage landscapes — planted, graded depressions that receive plowed snow without blocking circulation or killing vegetation. Size each storage zone to hold at least 150 millimeters of snow water equivalent from its contributing cleared area — typically 15 percent of the plowed surface. Grade the zone to slope away from buildings at a minimum 2 percent grade, with overflow channels connecting to the bioswale network (119) or infiltration basins (120). Plant with salt-tolerant, flexible-stemmed species: willows, red-osier dogwood, switchgrass, or native sedges that survive burial and filter pollutants during melt. Locate storage zones where snow can be pushed by the shortest plow route, and never at intersection corners where sightlines must be preserved. The test: in mid-March, when the pile is at its largest, can a child standing at the crosswalk see an approaching car? And in mid-April, does the meltwater flow to planted ground or to the storm drain?**
