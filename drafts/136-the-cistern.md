# 136. The Cistern [☆]

**…beyond Rainwater as Resource (26), The Rain Garden (19), The Water Budget (70), and The Visible Utility (68)…**

**When water falls free from the sky but runs straight to the storm drain, and then weeks later gardens wither while you pay for treated municipal water to keep them alive, the logic of contemporary plumbing reveals itself as a peculiar form of madness. The spring overwhelms; the summer parches. The problem is not water — it is time.**

The cistern is among humanity's oldest water technologies. Roman houses had their *impluvium*; Mayan cities built *chultuns* carved into limestone; the island of Bermuda requires every roof to collect rainwater by law, a practice dating to the 1600s. What these traditions understood — and what modern infrastructure has forgotten — is that rainfall is episodic, but need is continuous. Storage bridges the gap.

The arithmetic is straightforward. A 100-square-meter roof in Edmonton receives roughly 450mm of annual precipitation — 45,000 liters of water falling on a modest house each year. Meanwhile, a typical household garden requires 500-1,000 liters per week through July and August, the driest months. A 5,000-liter cistern, filled by spring rains and snowmelt, can carry a kitchen garden through summer drought without touching the municipal supply. The sizing follows from The Water Budget (70): calculate what falls, calculate what you need, store the difference.

Yet the cistern solves more than household economics. Municipal stormwater systems are sized for typical rainfall, not for the increasingly common downpour. When Edmonton received 50mm of rain in a single July afternoon in 2012, basements flooded across the city. Each cistern acts as a decentralized surge tank, absorbing the peak flow that would otherwise overwhelm the system. Austin, Texas recognized this when it began offering rebates for rainwater collection — not primarily for water conservation, but for stormwater management. The cistern serves two masters: the garden in drought and the drain in deluge.

The question of visibility matters. A cistern buried in the yard and connected by invisible pipes functions, but teaches nothing. The household that cannot see its water level, cannot trace its plumbing, cannot check its first-flush diverter, will not maintain its system and will not understand its water. Following The Visible Utility (68), the cistern should be present — not hidden. An above-ground tank near the garden, with a sight glass showing the water level, connects the household to its water in ways that a buried plastic vault never can. The children who watch the tank fill during a rainstorm and empty through summer watering learn something no textbook can teach.

In cold climates, the cistern must either be buried below the frost line (1.8 meters in Edmonton), drained before freeze-up, or located in a conditioned space. A cistern in an unheated garage will freeze and crack. A buried cistern requires a pump. These are not obstacles — they are design constraints. The pattern still holds; only the implementation varies.

**Therefore: install a cistern — above-ground where climate permits, below the frost line where it does not — sized to store at least 50 liters per square meter of roof area. Connect it to roof downspouts through a first-flush diverter that discards the initial dirty runoff. Make the water level visible: a sight glass, a float gauge, or a simple dipstick. Locate the cistern where it can gravity-feed to the garden, or provide a small pump. The cistern is full when spring ends and empty when summer ends — this is the test. A cistern that still holds water in September is oversized or underused; one that runs dry in July is too small for the garden it serves.**
