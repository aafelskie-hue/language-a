# 139. The Mall Transformation [★]

**…beyond The Fifteen-Minute Neighborhood (1), Suburban Densification (29), Incremental Development (100), and The Adaptive Reuse Toolkit (138)…**

**When a regional mall dies, its owners face an impossible choice: demolish millions of square feet of structure at enormous cost, or let a building designed for one purpose — continuous, windowless, internalized retail — sit vacant while the sea of parking around it repels any new use. The community inherits an asphalt wound at the heart of their suburb, too large to ignore, too expensive to heal, and too inhospitable to simply reoccupy.**

The enclosed regional mall was an American invention of the 1950s, scaled for the automobile and designed to turn its back on the world. Victor Gruen's Southdale Center in Edina, Minnesota (1956) set the template: anchor stores at each end, a climate-controlled concourse between them, and parking fields in every direction. By 2023, Green Street Advisors estimated that 1,100 malls remained in the United States, down from a peak of over 2,500, with roughly a quarter classified as dying or dead — vacancy rates above 40%, anchor departures, declining foot traffic. These are not small sites. A typical dead mall sits on 40 to 80 acres, much of it surface parking. The building itself may contain 500,000 to 1.2 million square feet of floor area.

The most instructive transformations treat the mall not as a building to be gutted but as infrastructure to be carved. Belmar, in Lakewood, Colorado, replaced the Villa Italia Mall (demolished 2001–2003) with 22 walkable blocks, a street grid reconnecting the surrounding neighborhood, 1,300 housing units, and 900,000 square feet of retail and office. Mashpee Commons on Cape Cod took a different path: the existing mall structure was incrementally converted and extended into a village center with housing above shops, beginning in 1986 and continuing for three decades. Both projects restored what the mall had erased — a public street network, buildings that face outward, housing mixed with commerce — but Mashpee did so while reusing the existing structure, while Belmar required complete demolition.

The key spatial problem is the same one faced in Office-to-Housing Conversion (27): the deep, windowless floor plate. Mall anchor stores are often 200 feet deep with no natural light. The concourse is an interior street. To bring housing into this envelope, you must carve — atria, courtyards, streets cut through the mass — and you must build outward into the parking field, creating new buildings that are properly proportioned for residential use. The parking itself is the opportunity: forty acres of asphalt is forty acres of developable land, already graded, already served by utilities, already connected to arterial roads.

Alexander's Identifiable Neighborhood (14) insisted that a neighborhood be small enough to know — no more than 500 households. The dead mall inverts this: it is a non-neighborhood, a void without residents, without eyes on the street, without anyone who belongs. The transformation succeeds when it creates not one neighborhood but several, each with its own center, its own green, its own identity — the blocks emerging from the parking field like islands rising from a drained lake.

**Therefore: when converting a dead or dying mall, begin by cutting a street grid through the parking field — blocks no larger than 400 feet on a side, streets connecting to the surrounding neighborhood. Carve the mall structure with daylit atria and courtyards to create residential floor plates no deeper than 45 feet. Build new mixed-use buildings along the new streets, three to six stories, with ground floors designed for shops and services per The Mixed-Use Ground Floor (99). Retain and adapt portions of the existing mall structure where floor-to-floor heights and column spacing permit conversion; demolish only what cannot be made habitable. Phase the work over ten to twenty years per Incremental Development (100), allowing different builders, different building types, different price points. The transformation is complete when at least 1,500 housing units occupy the site, when a resident can walk to groceries, a park, and transit within fifteen minutes, and when the street grid connects seamlessly to the surrounding neighborhood at no fewer than eight points.**
