To complete this research task properly, please grant permission to use web search capabilities. The concept of 'overland flow paths' and 'overflow routes' is well-established in stormwater engineering, but I cannot provide properly sourced citations without search access. Known terms to search: 'overland flow path', 'major/minor drainage system', 'emergency spillway', 'exceedance flow routing', Australian stormwater guidelines (which are known to have strong overland flow requirements)."
