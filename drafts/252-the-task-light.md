# 252. The Task Light [★]

**…beyond Light on Two Sides (34), The Dimmable Lighting (251), Circadian Architecture (83), and Borrowed Light (85)…**

**When an entire room is lit to uniform brightness, detailed work suffers — the face casts a shadow on the page, the needle disappears against the fabric, the circuit board becomes a field of gray. Yet when only task lights are used, the surrounding darkness strains the eye as it shifts between bright focus and dim periphery. The body wants both: concentrated light where the hands are working, and enough ambient glow to orient the room.**

Alexander, in his original Pattern 252 (Pools of Light), understood this tension. He wrote of spaces made human by islands of brightness surrounded by relative darkness — a rejection of the institutional demand for uniform illumination everywhere. But he stopped short of specifying how the task light itself should be arranged relative to the work, the body, and the room.

The Illuminating Engineering Society's *Lighting Handbook* distinguishes task-ambient systems from uniform overhead lighting. Task-ambient design provides 300-500 lux at the work surface from a dedicated fixture, while ambient lighting holds the surrounding room at 100-200 lux. The ratio matters: when the surround falls below one-third of the task illumination, the eye fatigues from constant adaptation. When the surround exceeds two-thirds, the task light loses its function.

Position is everything. A desk lamp placed behind the dominant hand casts the hand's shadow onto the page. A lamp placed in front creates glare off glossy surfaces. The IES recommends positioning task lights 30-45 degrees from the work surface, opposite the dominant hand, with the light source itself shielded from direct view. For a right-handed person reading at a desk, this means the lamp sits forward and to the left, its shade angled down toward the page. For sewing or soldering — work that requires seeing texture and relief — the light should rake across the surface at a lower angle, 15-20 degrees, so that small features cast visible shadows.

The light shelf (250) and borrowed light (85) bring daylight deep into rooms; the dimmable fixture (251) allows that light to shift with the hour. But neither addresses the local intensity needed when the eye must resolve fine detail. A room perfectly lit for conversation at 200 lux leaves the watchmaker blind. A room lit for surgery at 1000 lux makes the dinner guest squint. The task light bridges this gap — it brings high intensity to a small area without flooding the room.

In Edmonton's long winter evenings, when electric light dominates from 4 PM onward, the task light becomes the room's primary source of focused illumination. Combined with circadian architecture (83), the task light should offer warm color temperature (2700-3000K) for evening handwork, while maintaining the option for cooler, brighter light (4000K) when precise color discrimination matters — fabric selection, paint mixing, electronic component identification. A dual-temperature fixture, or separate warm and cool task lamps, serves both needs.

**Therefore: at every place where focused work occurs — desk, reading chair, workbench, sewing table, kitchen counter where knives are used — provide a dedicated task light positioned 30-45 degrees from the work surface, opposite the user's dominant hand, with the light source shielded from direct view. Size the pool of light to cover the active work area plus 150mm margin. Aim for 400-500 lux at the task surface while ambient room light holds at 100-200 lux. Test by reading 8-point type comfortably without leaning forward, and by confirming that the hand does not cast a shadow on the work.**

**…this pattern stands at the smallest scale of its chain — the final, most local implementation of the room's lighting system.**
