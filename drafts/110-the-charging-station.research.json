  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research due to tool permissions not being granted. This pattern about household charging stations would benefit from evidence about: (1) statistics on average connected devices per household, (2) studies on cable clutter and home organization, (3) building code requirements for USB outlets, (4) examples of built-in charging furniture or architectural solutions. Without web access, I cannot verify any specific citations or statistics. The pattern concept is intuitively sound but requires proper research to establish evidence base."
