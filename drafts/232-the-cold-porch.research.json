  "notes": "Unable to conduct web searches to gather evidence. The 'cold porch' concept relates to established cold-climate architectural features like arctic entries (Alaska/Canada), mudrooms, and Japanese genkan, but I cannot provide specific citations, statistics, or program details without web search access. To properly research this pattern, searches should target: (1) arctic entry/vestibule building codes in Alaska and northern Canada, (2) Cold Climate Housing Research Center studies, (3) Scandinavian building standards for entryways, (4) Japanese genkan traditions in Hokkaido. Grant web search permission to gather verifiable evidence."
