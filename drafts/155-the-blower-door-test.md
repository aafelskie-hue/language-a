# 155. The Blower Door Test [★]

**…beyond Building Envelope as Climate System (22) and The Smoke-Sealed Room (117)…**

**When a building's air barrier is designed on paper and executed with care, there is no way to know whether it actually works until you pressurize the building and measure. Hidden gaps behind electrical boxes, missed seams at partition intersections, and failed tape joints are invisible once drywall covers them — yet a single 1% leak in an otherwise tight envelope can double the effective air leakage rate, wasting years of heating fuel and making comfort impossible to achieve.**

The blower door test is brutally simple: a calibrated fan mounted in an exterior doorway pressurizes (or depressurizes) the building to 50 pascals — roughly the pressure of a 20 km/h wind on all sides at once — and measures how much air leaks through the envelope. The result, expressed as air changes per hour at 50 pascals (ACH50), tells you whether your air barrier exists or is wishful thinking. Canada's R-2000 program, launched in 1982, was the first national program to require mandatory blower door testing for certification, establishing 1.5 ACH50 as the target. Passive House International tightened this to 0.6 ACH50 — so tight that a house can be heated with a hair dryer. Between these extremes lies the range where most high-performance buildings operate.

In Edmonton, where heating degree days exceed 5,200 annually and January temperatures routinely drop below -25°C, air leakage matters more than almost anywhere in North America. Cold air is dense; it pushes hard against the warm air column inside a building, creating stack-effect pressure differences of 10-15 pascals in a two-storey house — enough to drive infiltration through every gap in the envelope. The Canadian Centre for Housing Technology tested identical houses in Ottawa and found that improving airtightness from 3.0 ACH50 to 1.5 ACH50 reduced space heating energy by approximately 20%. In Edmonton's harsher climate, the savings would be greater still. But more than energy is at stake: when warm, humid interior air leaks into cold wall cavities, it condenses and freezes. Come spring, it melts. The cycles repeat until rot sets in. A tight envelope isn't just efficient — it's durable.

The critical insight is timing. A blower door test performed after the air barrier is complete but before insulation and drywall are installed reveals every flaw while repairs are still possible. At this stage, a smoke pencil or theatrical fog machine combined with the pressurized building turns invisible leaks into visible streams. You can watch cold air pour through a missed bead of acoustical sealant, mark it, fix it, and test again. The same leak discovered after occupancy requires exploratory surgery — removing finishes, guessing at locations, hoping you found them all. The pre-drywall blower door test typically costs $300-500 CAD and takes two hours; remediation at that stage costs minutes of labor and dollars of sealant. Post-occupancy, the same repairs can run into thousands of dollars and may never fully succeed.

**Therefore: conduct a blower door test at the pre-drywall stage, after the air barrier is substantially complete but before it is concealed. During the test, walk the building with a smoke pencil or fog machine to identify every leak location. Mark each leak visibly. Repair, re-test, and repeat until the building achieves its target airtightness. For cold-climate high-performance buildings in Edmonton, target 1.5 ACH50 or better; for Passive House certification, 0.6 ACH50. Document the final test result and the leak locations found — this record protects both builder and owner.**
