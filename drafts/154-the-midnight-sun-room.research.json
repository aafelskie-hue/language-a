  "notes": "Unable to conduct web searches to verify evidence. While the pattern premise is well-founded (midnight sun regions do experience extended daylight disrupting sleep), I cannot provide verifiable citations without search access. Known relevant topics that COULD be researched with proper tools: Norwegian/Swedish building regulations for bedroom windows, Finnish sleep research institutes' work on circadian disruption, IKEA's blackout blind product development for Nordic markets, Alaska and northern Canada housing standards. This pattern deserves proper research before publication - the phenomenon is real but evidence needs verification."
