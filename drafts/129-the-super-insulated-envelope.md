# 129. The Super-Insulated Envelope [★★]

**…beyond BUILDING ENVELOPE AS CLIMATE SYSTEM (22) and PASSIVE SOLAR DESIGN (126)…**

**When code-minimum walls meet extreme cold, a tension emerges: thinner assemblies cost less to build but more to operate, while truly adequate insulation demands wall depths and details that conventional framing cannot accommodate. The homeowner pays either at construction or every winter thereafter — and in a climate with 5,200 heating degree days, that payment compounds for decades.**

Edmonton's winters are not merely cold; they are sustained. Between November and March, the city experiences roughly 140 days where the mean temperature stays below freezing. The 2020 Alberta Building Code requires R-22 for walls — a value calibrated to economic payback periods, not thermal comfort or energy independence. At -30°C, an R-22 wall with an interior setpoint of 21°C produces a temperature gradient of 2.3°C per R-value. The interior surface of that wall hovers around 15°C — cool enough to create convective drafts, cold enough that occupants unconsciously avoid sitting near exterior walls.

The Passive House standard, developed in Darmstadt and tested across 65,000 buildings worldwide, specifies a different threshold: a maximum heating demand of 15 kWh/m² per year. To achieve this in Edmonton's climate, the BuildABILITY Group's 2017 study of high-performance housing found that walls require R-40 to R-60, roofs R-60 to R-80. These are not arbitrary targets but the point at which a building's heating load becomes so small that it can be met by internal gains — body heat, appliances, sunlight — supplemented by a small heat pump. The 2012 Mill Creek NetZero Home, built by Habitat Studio in Edmonton, used a double-stud wall with R-56 insulation and achieved a measured heating demand of 12.8 kWh/m² annually — 85% below code-built homes in the same neighborhood.

The physics are simple: heat loss through a wall assembly is inversely proportional to R-value. Doubling insulation halves heat loss. But there are diminishing returns, and the curve flattens above R-40. The Passivhaus Institut's research shows that in heating-dominated climates (above 4,000 HDD), the optimal wall R-value falls between R-40 and R-60 — beyond that, the additional material cost exceeds lifetime energy savings. The critical insight is that super-insulation changes the building's thermal behavior fundamentally. A code-minimum house in Edmonton might require 120 GJ of natural gas annually; a super-insulated envelope reduces this to 15-25 GJ, a load small enough to be met by a cold-climate heat pump even at -30°C.

The assembly itself matters. Moisture drives inward in winter, outward in summer; in Edmonton, the winter vapor drive dominates. The 2019 Building Science Corporation study of double-stud walls in cold climates found that assemblies with exterior insulation (at least R-10 outboard of the sheathing) kept the sheathing above the dew point even at -35°C, eliminating condensation risk. The wall must dry to the exterior, which means vapor-permeable weather barriers and no interior polyethylene — a departure from 1980s practice that newer codes are slowly recognizing.

What does this mean for the person living inside? It means sitting by the window in January without a blanket. It means the furnace running so rarely that you forget its sound. It means that during the February 2021 polar vortex, when temperatures hit -40°C for three consecutive days, super-insulated homes in Edmonton maintained 18°C interiors for over 48 hours with no active heating — long enough to outlast most power outages. The wall becomes not just insulation but resilience, not just energy savings but thermal autonomy.

**Therefore: build walls with a minimum R-value of 40 and roofs with a minimum R-value of 60, using assemblies that place at least 25% of the total R-value outboard of the structural sheathing. Achieve this through double-stud framing with dense-pack cellulose, exterior rigid insulation over conventional framing, or insulated concrete forms — but always with a continuous air barrier achieving less than 0.6 ACH50. Test the assembly: at -25°C outdoor temperature and 21°C indoor setpoint, the interior surface of the wall should measure no less than 18°C. This is the wall you can lean against in winter.**
