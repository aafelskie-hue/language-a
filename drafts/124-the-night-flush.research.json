Night flush/night purge ventilation is a well-documented passive cooling strategy in building science literature, but I cannot provide verified citations without web access. Known areas of evidence include: California Title 24 building standards (which reference night precooling), ASHRAE research on thermal mass and ventilation, and European studies on passive cooling in commercial buildings.
