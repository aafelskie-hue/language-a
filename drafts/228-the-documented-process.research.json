This pattern concept (documented construction process stored with buildings) is well-established in practice through BIM requirements, O&M manuals, and building logbooks, but I cannot provide verified citations without search access. Known relevant topics that would need verification: UK Building Regulations requiring O&M manuals, BIM Level 2 mandates, COBie data requirements, Golden Thread requirements post-Grenfell, and historic building archives programs. Please re-run with web search permissions enabled."
