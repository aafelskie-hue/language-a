  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - search and fetch permissions not granted. Cannot provide verified citations without access to search tools. The sunspace/attached solar room concept has substantial historical documentation in passive solar literature (e.g., Edward Mazria's 'The Passive Solar Energy Book', DOE research from 1970s-1980s, NREL publications), but I cannot verify current URLs or confirm specific statistics without web access. Recommend re-running this research task with web search permissions enabled."
