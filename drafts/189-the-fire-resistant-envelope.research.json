  "notes": "Unable to verify evidence - web search and fetch tools are not available. This pattern topic (fire-resistant building envelopes, WUI codes, ember-resistant construction) has substantial real-world evidence from sources like California's Chapter 7A building codes, IBHS Wildfire Prepared Home program, NFPA Firewise USA, and post-fire studies of communities like Paradise CA. However, I cannot provide specific citations, statistics, or program outcomes without being able to verify them through web search. Please grant WebSearch or WebFetch permissions to gather verifiable evidence, or manually research: (1) California Building Code Chapter 7A, (2) IBHS wildfire research, (3) NFPA Firewise USA statistics, (4) Post-disaster studies of Camp Fire, Marshall Fire, etc."
