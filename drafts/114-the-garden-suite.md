# 114. The Garden Suite [★]

**…beyond The Pocket Neighborhood (111), The Laneway House (13), and The Multigenerational Suite (14)…**

**When secondary suites are permitted only in basements or above garages, they become dark afterthoughts — half-buried rooms with borrowed light, apartments perched over oil stains and car exhaust. The occupant has a place to sleep, but not a place to live. Yet when a detached cottage is dropped into a backyard without care, it destroys the garden it sits in, leaving no outdoor space worth using for anyone. The tension is this: people need small, dignified dwellings that feel like homes, but gardens need to remain gardens — shaped outdoor rooms, not leftover gaps between buildings.**

The garden suite resolves this tension by treating the dwelling and the garden as one design problem. Vancouver's laneway housing program, which had produced over 4,000 units by 2022, demonstrated that small detached dwellings could be added to existing lots without destroying the character of neighborhoods — but Vancouver's narrow lots and rear lanes created a specific condition. The garden suite addresses a different geometry: the deep lot with side or rear yard, where the dwelling must be woven into planted space rather than pushed to a laneway edge.

Toronto's 2022 Garden Suites Zoning By-law Amendment permitted garden suites city-wide on lots with detached, semi-detached, and townhouses, allowing structures up to 4 meters (one storey) or 6 meters (two storeys with conditions). The by-law recognized what Alexander saw in his pattern 109 (Long Thin House): that a small dwelling gains dignity not from size but from its relationship to light, garden, and entrance. Portland's ADU survey (2018) found that 65% of accessory dwelling occupants were family members or friends of property owners — these are not anonymous tenants but people whose lives are intertwined with those in the main house. The dwelling must be close enough for daily connection, separate enough for genuine privacy.

Wegmann and Chapple (2014) studied backyard cottages across California and found they provided affordable housing without changing neighborhood character, but faced persistent barriers: parking requirements, utility connection fees, and minimum lot sizes that excluded precisely the urban lots where gentle density makes most sense. The garden suite succeeds where it is treated as a building in a garden, not a garage with a bed. This means the dwelling shapes the outdoor space rather than consuming it — creating, as Positive Outdoor Space (36) requires, a room without a ceiling between the two structures. The suite's windows look onto plants, not fences. Its entrance has a path through greenery, not across asphalt.

**Therefore: on any lot deep enough to accommodate it, allow a garden suite of forty to seventy square meters, sited so that it creates shaped outdoor space between itself and the main house rather than eliminating the garden. Set the suite back at least four meters from the main dwelling to establish acoustic and visual privacy. Orient the suite's primary windows toward garden space, not toward neighboring windows or blank walls. Give the suite its own entrance path — a walk through the garden, not a corridor along the fence. The test: stand in the doorway of the garden suite and observe — you should see living plants within three meters in at least two directions, and the space between the two dwellings should feel like a courtyard or garden room, not a setback.**

**…this pattern connects to Positive Outdoor Space (36), Nature in Every Room (30), The Care Suite (80), and The Permeable Lot (20)…**
