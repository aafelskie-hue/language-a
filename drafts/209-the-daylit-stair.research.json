  "notes": "Unable to verify evidence - web search and fetch tools are not available. I have background knowledge suggesting that NYC Active Design Guidelines (2010), CDC stair promotion research, and WELL Building Standard include relevant provisions for daylit stairs and stair visibility, but I cannot verify current URLs, exact statistics, or confirm these sources are still accurate without web access. To properly research this pattern, I would need permission to use WebSearch or WebFetch tools. Known organizations to investigate: Center for Active Design (NYC), CDC Physical Activity guidelines, WELL Building Standard v2 (Movement concept), and academic research by Karen Lee and others on active design. Do not use this unverified information - grant web access for proper sourcing."
