# 162. The Shared Vehicle Fleet [☆]

**…beyond THE MOBILITY HUB (4), THE TOOL LIBRARY (91), and COMMON STORAGE (95)…**

**When every household owns vehicles for occasional needs — the truck for moving day, the second car for airport runs, the cargo bike for grocery hauls — parking consumes land that could be garden or gathering space, and vehicles worth tens of thousands of dollars sit idle twenty-two hours a day. Yet without access to a vehicle when you need one, you are trapped: the sick child cannot reach the clinic, the lumber cannot reach the workshop, the family cannot reach the trailhead. The problem is not cars. The problem is that ownership is the only form of access.**

The average privately owned car in North America sits parked 95% of its life. A household with two cars — common in any neighborhood without robust transit — dedicates 30 to 50 square meters of land to storing those vehicles: driveway, garage, street frontage. Multiply by a hundred households and the neighborhood has surrendered half a hectare to vehicle storage alone. That land cannot grow food, collect rain, host children, or build community. It stores steel.

Shared vehicle fleets invert this arithmetic. Switzerland's Mobility cooperative, founded in 1997, now operates over 3,000 vehicles serving more than 250,000 members across the country. Their data shows that each shared vehicle replaces between four and eight privately owned cars. Bremen's stadtmobil network, operating since 1990, reports similar ratios in German cities. The mechanism is simple: when a vehicle is available but not owned, people use it for what it does well — hauling, traveling distance, carrying groups — and default to walking, cycling, and transit for everything else. Vehicle-kilometers traveled per household drop by 30 to 50 percent. The fleet itself can be smaller, and the land it requires shrinks proportionally.

The tool library model (91) proves that shared access to expensive, occasionally-used equipment works at the neighborhood scale. A circular saw used ten times a year does not need to live in every garage. Neither does a pickup truck driven twice a month. The fleet extends this logic to mobility: the cargo bike for the weekly Costco run, the van for the Scout camping trip, the sedan for the airport. Housed at or near the mobility hub (4), the fleet becomes part of the transfer infrastructure — visible, accessible, integrated into the daily flow of the neighborhood rather than hidden in private garages.

What makes a shared fleet work is not ideology but logistics: vehicles must be nearby, available when needed, and maintained to a standard higher than most private owners achieve. The Swiss and German cooperatives succeed because they invest in professional maintenance, real-time booking systems, and distributed parking — vehicles stationed within a five-minute walk of most members. Neighborhood-scale fleets in North America have struggled when they required driving to a central lot or competing with commercial car-share services that optimize for downtown density, not residential access.

**Therefore: establish a neighborhood vehicle fleet of six to twelve vehicles — a mix of compact cars, cargo bikes, and at least one truck or van — owned cooperatively by the households it serves. Station the fleet at THE MOBILITY HUB (4), with reserved parking bays, charging infrastructure per THE CHARGING THRESHOLD (11), and weather protection. Size the fleet so that no household is more than a five-minute walk from an available vehicle. The test: track private vehicle ownership among member households. Within three years, at least half should have reduced their household fleet by one car or eliminated private ownership entirely.**
