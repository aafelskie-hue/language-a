# 161. The Shared Workshop [☆]

**…beyond The Community Workshop (57), The Tool Library (91), The Repair Café (92), and Common Storage (95)…**

**When residents of a multi-unit building want to repair furniture, build shelves, or maintain their bicycles, they face a painful choice: haul materials and tools across the neighborhood to a community workshop, attempt delicate work in a cramped apartment where sawdust and noise disturb the neighbors, or simply give up and buy new. The neighborhood workshop serves the whole district but cannot serve the small, spontaneous projects that keep a household running — the drawer that needs re-gluing, the picture frame that needs cutting, the child's broken toy.**

Alexander, in Pattern 157 (Home Workshop), understood that making and repairing are fundamental human activities that require dedicated space: "Set aside one room, or a corner of a room, where people can work on hobbies, build things, do carpentry and household repairs." But he wrote for houses with spare rooms. In a 60-square-meter apartment, there is no spare room. The choice becomes: live without making, or move somewhere larger.

Cohousing communities have tested solutions. Muir Commons in Davis, California — one of the first cohousing developments in the United States, completed in 1991 — included a common workshop in its shared facilities from the beginning. Residents report using it for furniture repair, bicycle maintenance, and small woodworking projects that would be impossible in their units. Similar workshops appear in Danish cohousing (where the model originated in the 1970s), typically sized at 15–25 square meters and equipped with a workbench, basic hand tools, and one or two shared power tools.

The economics favor sharing at this scale. A decent table saw costs $800–$1,500 and requires 3 square meters of clear space around it. A drill press, a bench grinder, a router table — each demands money and space that few apartment dwellers can spare. But split among 20 or 30 households, the cost per unit becomes trivial, and the space is shared rather than duplicated. The building-scale workshop fills a gap the neighborhood workshop cannot: it is close enough for a twenty-minute repair, accessible in slippers, available at odd hours without traveling.

The critical design factors are containment and access. Sawdust, noise, and fumes cannot migrate into living spaces. The workshop needs its own ventilation — ideally direct exhaust to outdoors — and sound-dampening walls or ceiling. It must be reachable without passing through lobbies or corridors where noise and debris would disturb others: a ground-floor location with exterior access works best. And it must be bookable but also available for drop-in use, so that small repairs don't require advance planning.

**Therefore: in any multi-unit building of 20 or more households, provide a shared workshop of at least 15 square meters — a dedicated room with a solid workbench, a pegboard for hand tools, one shared table saw or bandsaw, a drill press, good task lighting, and direct exhaust ventilation. Locate it on the ground floor with an exterior door so materials can be carried in without passing through common corridors. Provide a simple booking system, but keep the space unlocked during reasonable hours for spontaneous use. The test: a resident can glue a broken chair, wait for it to dry, and carry it home — all within a two-hour window, without leaving the building.**
