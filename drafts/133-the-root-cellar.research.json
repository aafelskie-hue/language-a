  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - search and fetch tools are not available. Root cellars are a traditional technology with extensive historical use in cold climates (Newfoundland, Scandinavia, Russia), but I cannot provide verified citations without web access. Known examples include the Elliston Root Cellar Capital of the World in Newfoundland (over 130 historic root cellars), but I cannot verify current statistics or programs. Academic literature likely exists on passive cooling and earth-sheltered storage, but specific citations would require database access. Recommend enabling web search to complete this research properly."
