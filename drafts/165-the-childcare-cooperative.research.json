  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research due to tool permission restrictions. I have general knowledge that parent cooperative preschools exist (e.g., Pacific Oaks in California has historical significance, PCPI - Parent Cooperative Preschools International is an organization), but I cannot verify current statistics, outcomes, or specific program details without web access. The pattern concept itself is well-established in practice - parent cooperatives have existed since the 1910s-1920s in the US - but providing properly sourced, verifiable evidence requires web search capability. Please grant WebSearch permission and re-run this research task."
