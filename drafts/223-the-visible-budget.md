# 223. The Visible Budget [★]

**…beyond Participatory Budgeting Space (51), The Maintenance Commons (52), and The Cooperative Governance (219)…**

**When the money is invisible, the community is invisible to itself. Residents who never see where their fees go — who cannot trace the path from monthly dues to repaired sidewalk, from assessment to new playground — begin to suspect the worst. Rumors fill the vacuum. Attendance at meetings drops. Those who remain engaged become adversaries rather than partners, because opacity breeds accusation. Yet financial managers resist disclosure: they fear misinterpretation, second-guessing, the burden of constant explanation. The tension is real — transparency requires work, and not everyone reads a spreadsheet the same way. But the cost of opacity is higher: a community that cannot see its own collective action cannot believe in it.**

Porto Alegre, Brazil began its participatory budgeting process in 1989 with a radical premise: citizens would not only vote on priorities, but watch the money move. By 1997, water and sewage connections in participating neighborhoods had risen from 75% to 98%, according to World Bank documentation — in part because residents could see their votes becoming pipes in the ground. The visible connection between decision and outcome sustained participation across nearly two decades. Today, more than 11,000 participatory budgeting programs operate worldwide, according to the Participatory Budgeting Network, but the ones that endure share a common feature: they make the budget legible.

What does legibility look like? In Paris, the Budget Participatif launched in 2014 allocates a portion of the city's investment budget through citizen voting, with an online tracker showing each approved project's status — proposed, funded, under construction, complete. Citizens can watch their vote become a bench, a bike lane, a garden. In housing cooperatives that thrive, the monthly carrying charge is not a mystery. The best co-ops post a simple chart in the common room: this much for mortgage, this much for reserve, this much for maintenance, this much for common expenses. When the boiler breaks, residents know the reserve fund exists and can watch it work.

Alexander understood that visible infrastructure changes behavior. In The Visible Utility (68), he argued that pipes and wires hidden in walls guarantee expensive repairs — because what cannot be seen cannot be maintained. The same logic applies to collective finance. When the budget is sealed in a binder in the property manager's office, it becomes a source of suspicion rather than solidarity. When it hangs on a wall, updated monthly, it becomes a shared story.

The physical form matters. A digital dashboard helps, but it is not sufficient — not everyone checks the website, and screens do not anchor community life. The display must exist in the space where people already gather: the entrance to the community center, the wall of the common room, the bulletin board at the maintenance commons. It must be large enough to read without bending close, simple enough to understand in thirty seconds, and current enough to feel alive.

**Therefore: in every cooperative, strata council, or neighborhood association, install a visible budget display in the primary gathering space. Make it physical — a wall-mounted board, a poster, a dedicated screen — not merely online. Show income sources, major expense categories, reserve fund balances, and the status of current projects. Update it monthly. Design the display so a newcomer can answer three questions in under a minute: Where does the money come from? Where does it go? What is being built or fixed right now? Test the pattern this way: ask five residents at random what the reserve fund balance is. If three can answer within 20%, the budget is visible. If none can, it is not.**

**…this pattern connects to The Visible Utility (68), which applies the same logic of transparency to building systems, and to Common Room (Alexander 80), where the display should be located…**
