  "notes": "Unable to search for evidence - web search and fetch tools are not available. The stoop is a well-documented architectural feature historically associated with Dutch colonial architecture in New York (particularly Brooklyn brownstones) and has been discussed by urban theorists like Jane Jacobs in relation to 'eyes on the street' and neighborhood social life. However, without search access, I cannot provide verified citations, specific statistics, or current programs. To complete this research properly, I would need permission to use WebSearch or WebFetch tools to find: (1) Academic studies on semi-private transition spaces and social interaction, (2) Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) research on threshold spaces, (3) Historic preservation programs for stoop-front neighborhoods, (4) Urban renewal initiatives that have restored or promoted stoop architecture."
