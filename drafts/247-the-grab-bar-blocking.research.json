  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research due to tool permissions not being granted. I have general knowledge that grab bar blocking is addressed in: (1) ICC A117.1 Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities standard, (2) NAHB Certified Aging-in-Place Specialist (CAPS) program guidelines, (3) Various state visitability laws. However, I cannot verify specific statistics, outcomes, or citations without web access. To properly research this pattern, I would need to search for: ADA grab bar requirements, ICC A117.1 Section 607/608 specifications, state visitability legislation (like Georgia's 1992 law), AARP/NAHB aging-in-place research, and CDC fall prevention statistics. Please enable WebSearch or WebFetch permissions to complete this research task properly."
