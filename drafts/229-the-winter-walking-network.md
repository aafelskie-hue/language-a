# 229. The Winter Walking Network [★]

**…beyond The Fifteen-Minute Neighborhood (1), The Winter City Street (58), and Safe Streets for Children (72)…**

**When snow clearing follows the logic of traffic volume — arterials first, collectors second, local streets eventually, sidewalks if time permits — the pedestrian network fragments into isolated passable segments connected by treacherous gaps. The fifteen-minute walk to the grocery store becomes a thirty-minute ordeal through snowbanks and ice sheets, and the people who most need to walk — the elderly, children, those without cars — become prisoners in their homes until spring.**

Edmonton clears 4,700 lane-kilometers of roads but only 670 kilometers of sidewalks — roughly one-seventh the attention, though pedestrians are far more vulnerable to falls than drivers are to collisions. The city's 2020 Sidewalk Strategy acknowledged that sidewalk clearing takes up to four days after a snowfall to complete priority routes, by which time ice has bonded to concrete and remains until chinook or spring. During this window, pedestrian trips drop sharply. Data from the City of Edmonton's 2019 Winter City Strategy survey found that 68% of residents walk less in winter specifically because of poor sidewalk conditions — not cold temperatures, not darkness, but ice and snow underfoot.

The consequences are measurable and severe. Falls on icy sidewalks account for over 2,100 emergency department visits annually in Edmonton, according to Alberta Health Services data from 2018. The rate of hip fractures among Edmontonians over 65 doubles in January compared to July. These are not minor injuries — hip fractures in the elderly carry a one-year mortality rate of approximately 20%. Meanwhile, Finnish cities demonstrate an alternative approach. Oulu (population 210,000, latitude 65°N, colder than Edmonton) maintains a tiered pedestrian-priority clearing system: primary walking and cycling routes are cleared within two hours of snowfall, before roads. The city's winter cycling mode share remains at 12% — higher than most North American cities achieve in summer — because the network stays continuously passable.

The principle is simple but requires a reversal of assumptions: pedestrians are more vulnerable than drivers, therefore pedestrians come first. Alexander's pattern 52, Network of Paths and Cars, argued that pedestrian paths should form "the primary network" with car roads as "a secondary network." In winter cities, this hierarchy must extend to maintenance, not just design. A connected pedestrian network that disappears for four days after every snowfall is not a network at all — it is a fair-weather amenity. The test of a winter city is whether a mother with a stroller, or an eighty-year-old with a cane, can walk to the bus stop the morning after a 15-centimeter snowfall.

**Therefore: designate a Winter Walking Network — a continuous system of priority pedestrian routes connecting every home to transit stops, schools, grocery stores, and community centers within the fifteen-minute walk radius. Clear these routes within four hours of snowfall ending, before any road clearing begins. Mark the network with consistent wayfinding — a colored line, a distinct paving pattern, signage — so that residents know which routes will be passable. Size the network so that no dwelling is more than 200 meters from a priority route. The test: at 7 a.m. the morning after a December snowstorm, can a child walk to school and an elder walk to the bus stop without crossing uncleared snow or ice?**
