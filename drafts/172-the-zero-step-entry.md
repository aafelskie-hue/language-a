# 172. The Zero-Step Entry [★]

**…beyond The Aging-in-Community Network (77), The Lifetime Home (15), and The Entrance Sequence (35)…**

**When an entrance requires even a single step, a threshold emerges that divides the world into those who can enter and those who cannot. The wheelchair user waits outside. The parent with a stroller lifts and struggles. The elder with a walker calculates risk with every visit. Yet in cold climates, water must drain away from the foundation, frost heave lifts and cracks any slab at grade, and snow accumulates at every door — forces that have traditionally pushed entrances upward, away from the ground. The conflict is real: accessibility demands a level approach while climate demands elevation and drainage.**

Eleanor Smith, a wheelchair user in Atlanta, founded the visitability movement in 1986 through Concrete Change, arguing that every home should permit basic access for every visitor. Her three requirements were simple: one zero-step entrance, 32-inch interior doors, and a main-floor bathroom. By 2020, over 60 U.S. jurisdictions had adopted some form of visitability ordinance. The cost differential tells the story of when: adding a zero-step entrance during initial construction costs less than $100 in most cases; retrofitting later costs $5,000 to $10,000 or more, if it is possible at all.

Norway's TEK17 building code, in force since 2017, requires level access to the main entrance of all new residential buildings — not as an option or a variance, but as baseline. The Norwegians build at 60°N, colder and darker than Edmonton, and they have solved the drainage and frost problems that Canadian builders cite as obstacles. Their approach: careful site grading, covered approach walks, and thermal breaks at the threshold. The UK's Lifetime Homes standard, developed by Habinteg in 1999 and later incorporated into building regulations, similarly requires a level or gently sloping approach. Poundbury, the model village developed under Prince Charles's direction in Dorset, implemented these standards throughout — every dwelling accessible from the street.

In Edmonton, the forces sharpen. At -30°C, a step becomes glazed with ice. The threshold itself can frost over. Snow drifts against doors. Yet these same conditions make the zero-step entry more necessary, not less: a fall on a frozen step at 75 is not a bruise but a broken hip, a hospital stay, a move to long-term care. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies estimated in 2014 that only 5% of U.S. housing stock was accessible to wheelchair users. Canada's numbers are similar. By 2024, Statistics Canada projected that over 20% of Canadians would be 65 or older. The gap between the bodies that exist and the homes that exist is widening every year.

Alexander's Pattern 53, Main Entrance, insists that the entrance be visible, welcoming, and clearly marked — but he wrote from Berkeley, where a step up to the porch is a gesture of welcome rather than a barrier. In Edmonton, the zero-step entry must reconcile Alexander's warmth with the physics of cold: the entrance must still announce itself, still provide threshold and transition, still create the sequence of arrival — but without the step that excludes. The Winter Vestibule (147) provides the thermal airlock; the Wide Doorway (173) ensures passage. The zero-step entry provides the ground-level approach that makes both usable.

**Therefore: design every entrance so that a person can approach from the public way to the front door without ascending or descending any step. Grade the site to slope gently away from the building at no more than 1:20. Where the entrance cannot meet grade, provide a ramp integrated into the landscape — not a bolt-on afterthought — with a slope no steeper than 1:12 and a non-slip surface. Cover the approach for at least the final two meters to keep ice and snow from accumulating at the door. Set the threshold flush or nearly flush, with no lip greater than 13 millimeters. The test: a person in a manual wheelchair can roll from the sidewalk to the interior without assistance, without ramps that feel temporary, and without asking for a side entrance.**
