# 251. The Dimmable Lighting [★]

**…beyond Circadian Architecture (83), The Dark Season Room (61), and The Winter Light Room (82)…**

**When electric lights are either on or off — full brightness or nothing — the room cannot adapt to the task at hand, the hour of the day, or the season of the year. Reading demands 500 lux at the page; conversation wants 100 lux diffused across faces; the hour before sleep wants less than 50 lux in warm amber. A single switch serves none of these moments well. Energy is wasted lighting an empty corner to surgical brightness. The body, receiving no gradient between day and night, loses its cues for winding down.**

The problem is not lighting itself but the absence of range. Alexander, in *Light on Two Sides of Every Room* (159), understood that the quality of light matters as much as the quantity — that a room lit from only one direction feels harsh and flat. But he wrote before the era of tunable LED fixtures, before we understood the circadian cost of blue-rich light at 10 PM, before smart dimmers became cheaper than the fixtures themselves. The principle holds: light must vary. The means have multiplied.

The Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has documented that light exposure above 100 lux at the eye in the two hours before sleep suppresses melatonin production and delays sleep onset by 30 to 60 minutes. Yet standard North American residential lighting delivers 150 to 300 lux throughout the evening. The fix is not simply "less light" but *controllable* light — fixtures that can drop to 30 lux at 9 PM while still reaching 500 lux at 7 AM for breakfast preparation. California's Title 24 energy code, updated in 2019, requires dimmable controls on all residential lighting precisely because the energy savings are substantial: a fixture dimmed to 50% consumes roughly 40% of full power (the relationship is not linear due to driver efficiency), and occupants who can dim will dim.

In The Dark Season Room (61) and Circadian Architecture (83), the goal is a building that helps the body know what time it is. But the electric lighting layer must cooperate with the daylight layer, or the circadian benefit is lost. A south-facing room flooded with winter sun at noon still needs electric light by 4 PM in December at 53°N. If that electric light is fixed at 4000K and 300 lux, the room fights the body's sunset signal. If it dims to 2700K and 80 lux, the room completes the day.

The dimmable fixture is also the honest fixture. It reveals what light is actually needed rather than defaulting to maximum. A reading chair with a dimmable task lamp teaches its occupant that 300 lux on the book is enough — the rest of the room can stay dim. A dining table with a pendant on a dimmer finds its own level: bright for homework, low for dinner, barely glowing for late wine. The room becomes a series of pools and shadows, not a uniformly lit box.

**Therefore: provide continuous dimming on every electric light fixture in rooms occupied after sunset. Use rotary or slide dimmers rather than stepped presets — the hand learns the gesture, and the light finds its level. In primary evening rooms (living room, bedroom, dining area), specify fixtures capable of dimming to at least 10% of maximum output without flicker. Where Circadian Architecture (83) calls for tunable color temperature, combine dimming with warm-shift: as brightness drops, color temperature should fall toward 2200K. Test the installation by dimming all fixtures to their minimum after dark — the room should still be navigable but feel distinctly different from midday.**
