# 177. The Pedestrian Shortcut [★]

**…beyond The Fifteen-Minute Neighborhood (1), The Local Street (43), Safe Streets for Children (72), and Green Corridors (44)…**

**When pedestrians must follow the same street grid as cars — walking the full perimeter of every block, waiting at every vehicular intersection, breathing exhaust at every crossing — distances stretch beyond what the clock suggests, and the fifteen-minute walk becomes twenty-five. The car has its own geometry; the pedestrian deserves another.**

The problem is mathematical before it is experiential. A standard Edmonton block measures roughly 120 meters by 60 meters. To walk from one corner to the opposite corner via the street requires 180 meters. A diagonal path through the block covers 134 meters — a 25% reduction. Across a ten-minute walk, these savings compound. Marshall and Garrick's 2010 study of street network patterns found that cities with finer-grained pedestrian networks — more intersections per square kilometer — showed measurably higher walking rates and lower traffic fatalities. The pedestrian shortcut is how you add intersections without adding streets.

Melbourne's laneway network offers the clearest built evidence. The city's 1994 "Places for People" study by Jan Gehl found that the laneways — originally service alleys for the Victorian street grid — carried 40% of all pedestrian movement through the central city, despite occupying a fraction of the street network's footprint. Melbourne did not build new laneways; it opened existing ones and made them walkable. The city installed lighting, paving, and cafés. The laneways became destinations and shortcuts simultaneously. Copenhagen's "strøget" passages, Barcelona's internal courtyard passages in the Eixample, and Tokyo's network of covered shopping arcades all demonstrate the same principle: when you give pedestrians a more direct route, they take it.

Alexander identified this in Pattern 52 (Network of Paths and Cars), arguing that pedestrian paths should form their own network, "more direct" than the vehicular streets and crossing them "at many points." What Alexander sketched in principle, the evidence now confirms in measurement. The pedestrian shortcut is not merely pleasant — it is the geometric correction that makes walking competitive with driving for short trips. In Edmonton, where winter daylight is scarce and cold discourages unnecessary outdoor time, every minute saved is a minute that might tip the decision from car to foot.

The shortcut must feel safe to be used. A path that runs behind garages, through unlit service yards, or along blank walls will be avoided — especially by women, children, and the elderly. Newman's 1972 work on defensible space established the principle: informal surveillance from adjacent uses makes public space feel safe. The best shortcuts pass windows, front doors, and active edges. They are visible from both ends before you enter. They are lit at night. A child walking home from school will use a shortcut that passes the back gardens of houses; she will not use one that runs between windowless garage walls.

**Therefore: wherever blocks exceed 100 meters on any side, create a mid-block pedestrian passage — a path at least 3 meters wide that connects one street to another without requiring vehicles. Align the passage so that walkers can see through it from end to end before entering. Line at least one side with windows, doors, or active frontage. Light the path to at least 50 lux at night. Where the passage crosses private property, secure a public easement; where it runs through a building, keep it open during all daylight hours. The test: a seven-year-old walking home from school should be able to use the shortcut without hesitation, and her route should be at least 20% shorter than the vehicular alternative.**
