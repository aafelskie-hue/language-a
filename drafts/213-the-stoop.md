# 213. The Stoop [★]

**…beyond The Entrance Sequence (35) and Walkable Density Gradient (40)…**

**When entrances open directly onto the sidewalk or retreat behind deep setbacks, residents lose the intermediate territory where private life meets public street. The door becomes a valve — open or closed, inside or outside — with no position in between. People rush from car to interior; neighbors pass without pause; the street loses its witnesses and its life.**

The stoop — a raised platform at the entrance, large enough to sit on — is among the oldest devices for creating this intermediate territory. The Dutch settlers who built New Amsterdam in the 1620s brought the "stoep" from Holland, where it served as a dry threshold above canal-side flooding. In Brooklyn's brownstone neighborhoods, the stoop became the defining social space of the block: a platform raised four to twelve steps above the sidewalk, typically 1.2 to 1.8 meters deep, where residents could sit, watch, and greet without fully committing to the public realm.

Jane Jacobs, observing these same Brooklyn streets in the 1950s, identified what she called "eyes on the street" — the informal surveillance that occurs when residents occupy the threshold between private and public. In *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* (1961), she argued that this casual watching — from stoops, from ground-floor windows, from shop fronts — was the primary source of urban safety, more effective than police patrols or street lighting alone. The stoop concentrates this watching at precisely the right height: elevated enough to survey the block, low enough to call out a greeting or hail a passing neighbor.

The elevation matters. Oscar Newman's *Defensible Space* research (1972) found that residents were more likely to monitor and intervene in spaces they perceived as their own territory. A stoop raised three to six steps above grade creates a psychological claim on the sidewalk below — the sitter owns the view, controls the approach, and can choose whether to engage or withdraw. At street level, this claim disappears; the passerby and the resident meet as equals, which is sometimes exactly wrong. The slight elevation gives the resident home-field advantage without creating fortress walls.

Alexander recognized this in Pattern 125 (Stair Seats): "Wherever there is a staircase, make its steps broad enough to sit on." But he treated the sitting-stair as an interior element. The stoop extends this logic outward, making the entrance itself a place to linger. It belongs to the entrance sequence (35) — it is the pause between gate and door, the moment of transition where you are neither fully inside nor fully outside. And it supports the doorstep play space (73): children playing on or near the stoop remain within earshot and sight of the sitting adult.

In dense urban fabric — the rowhouse, the brownstone, the townhouse — the stoop is often the only private outdoor space available. It substitutes for the porch, the front yard, the garden. At densities above 30 units per acre, where the walkable density gradient (40) demands compact building footprints, the stoop provides outdoor territory without consuming lot depth.

**Therefore: at every dwelling entrance on a public street, build a raised platform — a stoop — at least 1.2 meters deep and 1.5 meters wide, elevated three to six steps (500–1000mm) above sidewalk grade. Make the top step broad enough to sit on comfortably — at least 400mm deep. Orient the stoop to face the street. Test: a person sitting on the stoop should be able to see both ends of the block and make eye contact with passersby at normal speaking distance (3–5 meters).**
