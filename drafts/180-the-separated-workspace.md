# 180. The Separated Workspace [★]

**…beyond The Fifteen-Minute Neighborhood (1), The Shopfront Dwelling (170), and The Garden Suite (114)…**

**When professional work happens at home — a therapist seeing patients, an accountant meeting clients, a music teacher giving lessons — the worker faces an impossible choice: either clients enter through the family kitchen, past the children's boots and the breakfast dishes, violating the household's privacy and undermining professional credibility; or the worker rents an office elsewhere, adding commute time, carbon emissions, and monthly costs that often exceed the mortgage payment on a spare room. The home has space for work, but no way to make that work dignified for both the professional and the family.**

The problem is architectural, not scheduling. A therapist cannot ask a patient to wait in the living room where the teenager is doing homework. A piano teacher cannot receive students through a door that opens onto the master bedroom hallway. The issue is not noise or hours — those can be managed — but *path*. When the client's path and the family's path cross, both parties are diminished: the client sees too much of the domestic life, the family cannot retreat to genuine privacy. Alexander understood this in pattern 157, *Home Workshop*, where he wrote that "the workshop should open off the street, not off the house" — but he framed it around craft production, not professional services. The digital age has multiplied the professions that can operate from home while simultaneously making clients less tolerant of unprofessional settings. A Zoom background can be faked; a physical visit cannot.

Edmonton's zoning bylaw permits "home-based businesses" with up to two non-resident employees and client visits, provided traffic and parking impacts remain minimal — but the bylaw says nothing about entrance configuration. The City of Calgary's 2021 secondary suite policy permits "garden suites" of up to 95 square meters with separate entrances, and permits home occupations within them. Portland, Oregon, has since 2010 allowed detached accessory dwelling units (ADUs) with independent street access, and a 2019 survey by the Portland ADU Coalition found that 23% of permitted ADUs were used primarily as home offices or studios, not rental housing. In each case, the key enabling feature was the separate entrance — a path from street to workspace that does not pass through the dwelling.

The cold-climate version of this pattern must respect the thermal envelope. A separate entrance means a second airlock, a second set of heat losses, a second threshold to shovel. The Fifteen-Minute Shed (6) solves this for solo work by creating a detached structure, but client-facing work often requires more than ten square meters: a waiting area, an accessible washroom, room for equipment. The solution is to attach the workspace to the main dwelling — sharing the foundation, sharing the heating system — while providing a completely separate entrance sequence. The workspace becomes a wing, not a cottage; a lobe of the house that faces the street or the lane while the dwelling faces the garden.

The test is simple: can a client arrive, conduct business, and leave without ever seeing the family's private rooms, and without the family needing to hide? If a child can wander from bedroom to kitchen in pajamas while a client waits in the workspace vestibule, the separation is real.

**Therefore: when a dwelling includes professional workspace for client-facing work, provide that workspace with its own exterior entrance — directly from the street, the lane, or a garden path — that does not require passage through any room used by the household. The entrance should include a vestibule or waiting area of at least four square meters, insulated and heated to dwelling standard, with a place to sit, a place to hang a coat, and a view to the approach so visitors can be seen arriving. Provide an accessible washroom reachable from the workspace without entering the dwelling. The workspace itself should be at least twelve square meters for one-on-one consultations, or twenty square meters if small groups will gather. The workspace may share walls, foundation, and mechanical systems with the dwelling, but the interior connection — if any — must be through a lockable door that the household controls. The hard test: a stranger should be able to visit the workspace ten times without learning whether the household has children, what they eat for breakfast, or where they sleep.**
