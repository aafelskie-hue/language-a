# 151. Snow Load Design [★]

**…beyond The Sheltering Roof (37), The Solar Roof (127), and The Living Roof (131)…**

**When roofs are engineered to minimum code requirements, they may survive most winters — but the exceptional year, the one with wet heavy snow in March followed by freezing rain, reveals the difference between adequate and resilient. Yet overbuilding every roof for the century storm adds cost that discourages construction entirely. The tension: design for the normal year and risk catastrophic failure, or design for the worst case and make shelter unaffordable.**

The National Building Code of Canada specifies ground snow loads by location — Edmonton's specified ground snow load is 1.4 kPa (approximately 29 pounds per square foot), which assumes a certain return period and statistical probability. But ground snow load is not roof snow load. Drifting, sliding from upper roofs, and the geometry of valleys and parapets can concentrate loads to two or three times the uniform value. The 1978 Hartford Civic Center collapse, where 1,400 tonnes of steel space frame fell onto empty seats hours after a basketball game, resulted from accumulated ice and snow on a flat roof with inadequate drainage — a design that looked elegant but ignored the physics of winter.

In Scandinavian countries, where snow is not occasional but defining, traditional building practice evolved toward steep pitches — 30 to 45 degrees — that shed snow before dangerous accumulation. The Norwegian Standard NS 3491-3 requires designers to account for snow redistribution patterns, including the drift loads that form in the lee of parapets and at roof transitions. Finnish timber construction typically specifies roof structures capable of carrying 2.5 to 4.0 kPa, significantly above minimum requirements, because the cost of additional structure is small compared to the cost of failure. This northern European approach treats snow load not as an edge case to be minimized but as a primary design condition.

The physics are straightforward but often ignored: fresh powder weighs roughly 50-70 kg per cubic metre, but settled snow reaches 200-300 kg/m³, and ice approaches 900 kg/m³. A roof that easily carries 60 centimetres of January powder may fail under the same depth of March snow-ice composite. Flat and low-slope roofs are particularly vulnerable because they retain rather than shed, and because ponding from melted snow adds hydraulic load to the structural load. The critical failure mode is usually not sudden collapse but progressive deflection — the roof sags, pooling increases, load concentrates, and the structure yields. By the time the problem is visible from inside, it may be too late.

**Therefore: design roof structures for a minimum of 1.5 times the code-specified ground snow load for your location, plus explicit drift and sliding loads at all transitions, valleys, and parapets. Pitch primary roof surfaces at 4:12 (18 degrees) minimum to encourage shedding; pitch secondary roofs steeper where they receive sliding loads from above. At valleys and inside corners, double the local load assumption or provide positive drainage that cannot be blocked by ice. Specify structural members — rafters, trusses, ridge beams — for deflection limits of L/240 under full snow load (tighter than code minimum) so that sagging does not trigger progressive failure. The test: load the roof design in structural software with 2.0 kPa uniform plus drift concentrations; if any member exceeds 80% of capacity, the design is too light.**
