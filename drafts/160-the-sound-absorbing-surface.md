# 160. The Sound-Absorbing Surface [★]

**…beyond Sound Gradient (90) and The Sound Garden (87)…**

**When all surfaces in a room are hard and smooth — painted drywall, concrete, glass, tile — sound bounces from wall to wall with nowhere to die. Speech becomes muddy as early reflections pile onto late ones. Background noise builds. People raise their voices to be heard, which raises the noise floor further. The very hardness that makes surfaces durable and cleanable makes them acoustically punishing — and yet a room of nothing but soft absorption feels dead, muffled, strange. The ear wants clarity, not silence; presence, not echo.**

Sound behaves simply in rooms: it reflects off hard surfaces and absorbs into soft ones. The measure of this is the Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC), a single number from 0 to 1 representing the fraction of sound energy a material absorbs across speech frequencies. Painted concrete reflects nearly everything (NRC 0.02). Acoustic ceiling tiles absorb most of it (NRC 0.70–0.90). Between these extremes lie the materials that shape a room's character: heavy curtains (NRC 0.50–0.75), upholstered furniture (NRC 0.25–0.45), exposed brick (NRC 0.03–0.05), carpet on pad (NRC 0.30–0.55), perforated wood panels backed with mineral wool (NRC 0.60–0.85).

The problem in most rooms is not total absorption but placement and proportion. Reverberation time — how long sound lingers — depends on room volume, surface area, and the average absorption of all surfaces. A living room of 85 cubic meters with all hard surfaces might reverberate for 1.2 seconds; add a large area rug, a fabric sofa, and heavy curtains, and it drops to 0.6 seconds. The World Health Organization recommends classroom reverberation times below 0.6 seconds for speech intelligibility; homes benefit from similar targets in conversation areas. But bedrooms and studies can go lower — 0.4 seconds feels intimate, focused, private.

The mechanism is physical: porous materials trap air in their structure, and when sound waves push that air back and forth, friction converts acoustic energy to heat. This is why thin, hard-backed fabrics do little — sound passes through without enough resistance — while thick, open-cell materials perform well. The deeper the absorber, the lower the frequencies it controls. A 25mm acoustic panel absorbs high frequencies well but lets bass pass; a 100mm panel begins to tame the low end. For bass control without bulk, membrane absorbers (thin panels mounted with an air gap) resonate at specific frequencies and convert that energy to heat through panel flexion.

Alexander, in his original pattern language, wrote of THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE (Alexander 191) and the quality of "hardness" in construction, but did not address acoustic surfaces directly. This pattern fills that gap: the surfaces that quiet a room, that let voices land clearly and then stop, that prevent the exhaustion of shouting through dinner in a reverberant kitchen.

**Therefore: in every room where people gather or converse, cover at least 25 percent of the wall and ceiling area with absorptive material — fabric-wrapped panels, heavy textiles, perforated wood or metal backed with mineral wool, or thick carpet and pad on the floor. Place absorption at ear height on walls and on the ceiling above the seating area. Test the room by clapping once, sharply: if the sound rings for more than half a second, add absorption; if it dies instantly with no sense of the room's size, the space is overdamped — remove absorption or add reflective surfaces until the clap is crisp but brief. The ear will tell you when it is right.**
