Cannot verify any claims about sound lock construction, acoustic vestibules, or double-door/double-wall sound isolation without access to search capabilities. The pattern concept (acoustic buffer zones using double-wall or double-door construction) is well-established in acoustic engineering practice, but I cannot provide specific verified citations, statistics, or built examples without search access.
