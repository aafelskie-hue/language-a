# 130. Air Sealing Strategy [★]

**…beyond Building Envelope as Climate System (22)…**

**When air moves freely through cracks and gaps in a wall, insulation becomes theater — the R-value printed on the label has almost nothing to do with what happens inside the building. But when builders seal every penetration and joint obsessively, they risk trapping moisture inside walls, creating condensation problems that rot the structure from within. The forces pull in opposite directions: stop the air, but let the wall breathe; seal tight, but don't create a tomb.**

The physics are unforgiving. In Edmonton, where winter design temperatures drop to -33°C and heating degree days exceed 5,000 annually, warm indoor air carries substantial moisture. When that air leaks outward through a gap — around an electrical box, through a poorly taped joint, along a top plate — it hits the cold sheathing and condenses. A single unsealed penetration can deposit liters of water into a wall cavity over a winter. The insulation gets wet, loses its thermal resistance, and the cycle accelerates. This is not theory; it is the biography of thousands of failed walls across the prairie provinces.

Canada pioneered the measurement of this problem. The R-2000 program, launched by Natural Resources Canada in 1982, required blower door testing when most of the world had never heard of it. The standard demanded airtightness below 1.5 air changes per hour at 50 pascals (ACH50) — at a time when typical new construction leaked at 5 to 7 ACH50. Forty years of data from the program demonstrated that air leakage accounts for 25 to 40 percent of heating energy loss in cold-climate buildings. The Passive House standard, developed in Germany and now applied across northern climates, pushed further: 0.6 ACH50, verified by testing, with buildings achieving 75 to 90 percent energy reduction compared to conventional construction. In both programs, the air barrier is not an afterthought but a primary structural layer, drawn on plans, inspected during construction, and tested before occupancy.

The key insight from four decades of air sealing practice is this: the air barrier must be continuous and it must be defined. You cannot achieve airtightness by hoping that multiple layers will somehow add up. Someone must draw a single line on every section — through foundation, wall, ceiling, roof — and that line must connect without interruption. Where it crosses a material change (concrete to wood, framing to window), there must be a designed and durable transition. The Passive House practitioners call this the "red pen test": if you cannot trace the air barrier with a red pen from one side of the building to the other without lifting the pen, the design is incomplete.

Alexander did not write about air barriers — the building science was nascent in 1977. But his pattern *Roof Vaults* (Alexander 220) understood that buildings must respond to forces that move through them, not merely resist loads from above. Air is such a force. It moves relentlessly from high pressure to low, from warm to cold, carrying moisture and energy with it. The air barrier is the membrane that gives the building its integrity as a climate system.

**Therefore: before construction begins, draw the air barrier as a continuous line on every building section — foundation to roof, wall to window, floor to ceiling. Use a dedicated air barrier material appropriate to each assembly: sealed polyethylene or smart vapor retarders in wood-frame walls; taped sheathing or fluid-applied membranes on the exterior; gaskets and sealants at every penetration. At transitions between materials or trades, detail the connection explicitly and assign responsibility. Test the completed envelope with a blower door before insulation is concealed; achieve 1.5 ACH50 or better, with 0.6 ACH50 as the target for high-performance buildings. If the test fails, find and fix the leaks before the walls close.**
