  "notes": "Unable to complete research - web search and web fetch permissions not granted. Without access to search engines or authoritative URLs, I cannot provide verified evidence. Known relevant sources that should be consulted include: Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) guidance on ice dams, University of Minnesota Extension research on cold-climate roofing, CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation) building science publications, Building America research from US DOE, and insurance industry statistics from organizations like the Insurance Bureau of Canada. The underlying building science is well-established (cold roof design, proper attic ventilation, air sealing, adequate insulation), but I cannot cite specific numbers or programs without web access to verify them."
