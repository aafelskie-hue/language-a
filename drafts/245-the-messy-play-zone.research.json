I have general knowledge about messy play research and adventure playgrounds, but cannot provide properly sourced citations without the ability to search and verify current sources. Known relevant areas include: adventure playground movement (originating in Denmark post-WWII), nature kindergarten research, and early childhood education studies on sensory play - but I cannot confirm specific citations, dates, or statistics without search access. Please re-run this query with web search permissions enabled to get properly sourced evidence."
