  "notes": "Unable to gather evidence - web search and fetch permissions not granted. From general knowledge: Owner-builder permit programs exist in many US states (California's CSLB administers one, requiring signed disclosure statements), the UK has a 'Right to Build' policy (2016 Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act), and organizations like Habitat for Humanity use sweat-equity models. However, without ability to verify current details, URLs, statistics, and outcomes, I cannot provide properly sourced evidence. This pattern likely has MODERATE evidence available if properly researched with web access."
