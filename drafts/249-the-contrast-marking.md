# 249. The Contrast Marking [★]

**…beyond Universal Wayfinding (81), Universal Design Standard (171), The Daylit Stair (209), and The Zero-Step Entry (172)…**

**When stairs, level changes, and door frames are finished in continuous materials and uniform tones — the elegant travertine stair, the seamless oak floor flowing into an oak threshold — the building becomes treacherous for anyone whose vision has dimmed. The aesthetic of refinement demands visual continuity; the body demands warning at every place where falling is possible.**

The eye relies on contrast to parse depth. A stair tread that differs from its riser by less than 30 points on the light reflectance value (LRV) scale appears as a continuous slope to someone with cataracts, macular degeneration, or the ordinary presbyopia of age. The UK Building Regulations Approved Document M specifies a minimum LRV difference of 30 points between nosing and tread, and between critical surfaces and their surroundings — a number derived from clinical studies of visual detection thresholds in populations with low vision. Australia's AS 1428.1 requires a 30% luminance contrast at stair nosings and recommends 45-75mm strips for maximum detectability. The US Access Board's ADA guidelines call for visually contrasting stair nosings throughout regulated facilities.

Falls on stairs are not minor inconveniences. The UK's Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents reports that falls on stairs account for over 700 deaths annually in Britain — the majority among those over 65 — and many thousands more hip fractures and head injuries. A study published in *Injury Prevention* (Jacobs 2016) found that high-contrast edge markings reduced stair missteps by over 60% in controlled trials with older adults. The intervention is simple: a strip of contrasting material, 50 to 75 millimeters deep, applied to the leading edge of every tread, visible from both ascent and descent.

The same principle applies wherever the floor plane changes or a barrier appears. Door frames that match their walls disappear for the partially sighted; a contrasting frame edge, even a painted line, brings the opening into focus. Glass doors and sidelights need manifestation — horizontal bands at two heights — or they become invisible hazards. Floor transitions, from wood to tile or from one level to another, require a visible seam. The Canadian National Institute for the Blind recommends extending contrast markings to light switches, handrails, and grab bars: any element the hand must find.

Alexander did not write a pattern for contrast marking, though his Pattern 134 (Zen View) speaks of thresholds and transitions. What he understood — that the body reads space before the mind names it — applies here with medical urgency. The contrast marking is not decoration, not wayfinding signage, but a physical announcement: *something changes here.*

**Therefore: mark every stair nosing with a strip of contrasting material, 50 to 75 millimeters deep, running the full width of the tread, with a light reflectance value (LRV) at least 30 points different from the tread surface. Extend this contrast principle to all level changes, door frames, and glass panels. Apply a contrasting band to each side of door frames, at least 50 millimeters wide. Place manifestation strips on full-height glazing at 850-1000mm and 1400-1600mm above finished floor. Test by photograph: convert an image of the stair or threshold to grayscale — if the edge disappears, the contrast is insufficient.**

**…this pattern is the smallest scale in its chain; it receives from the patterns above and gives directly to the built surface itself…**
