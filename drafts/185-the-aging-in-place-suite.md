# 185. The Aging-in-Place Suite [★]

**…beyond The Pocket Neighborhood (111), The Lifetime Home (15), and The Multigenerational Suite (14)…**

**When all bedrooms sit upstairs and the only bathroom is at the top of the landing, the house becomes a trap as bodies age. The choice narrows to three bad options: climb stairs that grow more dangerous each year, spend $50,000 or more converting a main floor that was never designed for sleeping, or leave the home and neighborhood you have known for decades. The house that sheltered you in your forties evicts you in your seventies.**

The scale of this problem is demographic. Statistics Canada reported in 2021 that 93% of Canadians aged 65 and older wished to remain in their current home as long as possible. Yet CMHC's 2019 housing survey found that only 9% of Canadian homes had all three features necessary for basic aging in place: no-step entry, a bedroom on the main floor, and a main-floor bathroom. The gap between desire and design is vast.

The consequences of that gap are measurable. The Canadian Institute for Health Information found that in 2018-2019, falls were the leading cause of injury hospitalizations among seniors, with over 149,000 hospitalizations nationally. Stairs are implicated in approximately 20% of home fall injuries among those over 65, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Many of these falls occur not in public spaces but on the stairs between the bedroom and the kitchen — the daily vertical commute that two-story homes demand.

Visitability ordinances in cities like Pima County, Arizona (adopted 2002) and Atlanta, Georgia (the first in the U.S., 1992) have demonstrated that main-floor accessibility can be achieved at minimal additional cost when designed from the start — typically $100 to $600 per unit according to Concrete Change's implementation studies. The expense comes from retrofit, not foresight. Eleanor Smith, founder of Concrete Change and creator of the visitability movement, documented that homes built to visitable standards required no structural modification when residents aged or became disabled, while conventional homes faced renovation costs averaging $30,000 to $100,000 for accessibility conversion.

Alexander's Pattern 159, Light on Two Sides of Every Room, speaks to the dignity of inhabited space — the need for rooms that feel like places, not corridors. The aging-in-place suite must honor this: it is not a medical afterthought tucked behind the garage, but a proper room with windows on at least two walls, oriented to catch morning or afternoon light, connected to the life of the house. A room where one could live for years, not merely survive.

The suite differs from The Care Suite (80) in its timing and purpose. The care suite converts to clinical function during illness or end-of-life; the aging-in-place suite is simply a main-floor bedroom that eliminates stairs from daily life. It is preventive, not reactive. A person may live in it for twenty years without ever needing grab bars — but the walls are reinforced, the doorways are wide, and the path to the bathroom has no threshold.

**Therefore: in every new home, provide one bedroom on the main floor, no smaller than 11 by 12 feet, served by a full bathroom within 15 feet of the bedroom door. The bathroom must have a 36-inch doorway and blocking in the walls for future grab bars. The path from the bedroom to the bathroom, kitchen, and main entrance must be 36 inches wide throughout, with no steps and no thresholds higher than half an inch. The bedroom must have windows on at least two walls. Test: a person using a standard wheelchair (25 inches wide) should be able to enter the home, reach the bedroom and bathroom, and use all fixtures without assistance.**

**…this pattern connects to The Care Suite (80), The Permeable Lot (20), The Indoor Sun (171), The Gradient of Privacy (172), and The Room You Can Close (174)…**
