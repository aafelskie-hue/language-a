# 250. The Light Shelf [☆]

**…beyond Light on Two Sides (34), Borrowed Light (85), The Bright Winter Interior (231), and The Operable Shading (197)…**

**When a room has windows on only one wall, daylight floods the first few feet of floor and leaves the back half in permanent twilight. The window becomes a source of glare — too bright to look at, too dim to read by twelve feet away. People cluster near the glass or surrender to electric light all day. The very element meant to connect inside to outside creates a harsh boundary within the room itself.**

Daylight does not travel horizontally. It falls. A vertical window admits light that strikes the floor near the sill and scatters weakly beyond. The physics are simple geometry: light entering at typical sky angles (15° to 60° above horizontal) hits the floor within one to two times the head height of the window. In a room with a 2.4-meter ceiling and a standard window head at 2.1 meters, useful daylight — the kind you can read by without squinting — rarely penetrates more than 4 meters from the glass.

The light shelf interrupts this geometry. A horizontal surface, typically 300 to 600 millimeters deep, is mounted at or above eye level (1.8 to 2.1 meters) on a south-facing window. The upper surface is white or polished metal. Direct sunlight strikes this surface and bounces upward, hitting the ceiling and reflecting deeper into the room. The ceiling becomes a secondary light source — diffuse, even, and far gentler than direct sun. Meanwhile, the light shelf shades the lower window, reducing glare at desk level without blocking the view.

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's daylighting studies measured the effect: a properly designed light shelf can increase illumination at the back of a 9-meter-deep room by 20 to 40 percent compared to the same window without one. The key variables are ceiling height (the higher the ceiling, the deeper the bounce), shelf reflectivity (white paint at 85% reflectance minimum; specular aluminum reaches 95%), and orientation (south-facing in northern latitudes for maximum low-angle winter sun). East and west orientations require careful analysis — the low sun angle can cause glare beneath the shelf.

Alexander's Light on Two Sides of Every Room (194) addresses the quality of light through geometry — multiple sources, multiple directions. The light shelf is a construction detail that achieves a version of this even when only one exterior wall is available. It splits a single window into two zones: a view window below, admitting diffuse light and connection to the outdoors, and a clerestory zone above, bouncing daylight to the ceiling. The effect approaches what two windows on opposite walls would provide — light from above and light from the side, shadow on one surface balanced by illumination on another.

The detail is old. Edwardian schools in England used external light shelves to push daylight across deep classrooms. The Pacific Gas and Electric daylighting guidelines (1999) documented their use in California commercial buildings, noting energy savings of 30 to 50 percent in perimeter zones when combined with daylight-responsive dimming. Edmonton's latitude (53°N) offers low winter sun angles ideal for light-shelf geometry — the December noon sun at 13° above the horizon strikes a south-facing shelf almost directly, bouncing deep into the room precisely when electric lighting loads are highest.

**Therefore: on south-facing windows where the room extends more than 5 meters from the glass, install a light shelf — a horizontal surface 300 to 600 millimeters deep, mounted between 1.8 and 2.1 meters above the floor, with its upper surface finished in white or polished metal (minimum 85% reflectance). Set the window above the shelf as fixed or inoperable glazing; the window below may open. Test the design by measuring illumination at the back wall on a sunny day: the light shelf succeeds if the ratio of illumination at 1 meter from the window to illumination at 5 meters is less than 10:1.**
