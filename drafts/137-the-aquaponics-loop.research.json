While I have general knowledge about aquaponics (e.g., FAO has published technical papers, there are commercial facilities like Growing Power in Milwaukee and Gotham Greens, and studies on water efficiency exist), I cannot provide properly sourced citations with URLs, specific years, and verifiable statistics without being able to search and confirm current information. Please grant web search permissions to complete this research task properly."
