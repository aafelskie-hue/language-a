  "notes": "RESEARCH INCOMPLETE: Web search and fetch tools are not available. I have general knowledge about car-sharing programs (e.g., Zipcar, car2go, neighborhood cooperative fleets in European cities like Bremen and Freiburg, Swiss Mobility cooperative), but I cannot provide verified citations, specific statistics, or current program outcomes without access to search tools. To complete this research properly, please grant WebSearch permission and re-run this query. Known topics to search: 'Bremen stadtmobil car sharing', 'Swiss Mobility cooperative statistics', 'UC Berkeley Transportation Sustainability Research Center car sharing studies', 'SUMC Shared Mobility State of Industry Report'."
