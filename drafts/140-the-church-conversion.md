# 140. The Church Conversion [★]

**…beyond The Adaptive Reuse Toolkit (138), The Third Place Network (2), and Participatory Budgeting Space (51)…**

**When congregations shrink and can no longer sustain their buildings, these structures — often the finest architecture in a neighborhood, with soaring volumes, exceptional acoustics, and irreplaceable craftsmanship — face demolition or decay. But the very qualities that make churches worth saving also make them difficult to adapt: the single great room resists subdivision, the tall windows flood the space with light but leak heat, the sacred character feels violated by commercial uses, and the community that once gathered there watches the transformation with grief. The building's bones are excellent; the path to its next life is unclear.**

The scale of the problem is vast. The Churches Conservation Trust in England maintains over 350 redundant churches as heritage sites, but this represents a fraction of closures. In Canada, the National Trust estimated in 2019 that 9,000 religious buildings face closure risk within two decades — roughly one-third of the total stock. Edmonton alone has seen significant church closures in established neighborhoods: the former Robertson-Wesley United Church on 123rd Street sat empty for years before conversion to condominiums; the Rossdale Power Plant redevelopment incorporates the adjacent St. Joachim Catholic Church site. These buildings occupy prominent corner lots, anchor neighborhood identity, and represent construction quality — stone foundations, solid masonry walls, old-growth timber trusses — that would cost three to five times as much to replicate today.

The spatial challenge is specific. A typical urban church offers a nave volume of 8,000 to 15,000 cubic feet with ceiling heights of 25 to 40 feet — proportions that dwarf residential scale but fall short of industrial loft dimensions. The floor plate is usually undivided, making it ideal for assembly uses but difficult for housing without destroying the volume. The windows, often stained glass, cannot be replaced or blocked without erasing the building's character. The acoustic properties that carry a sermon also carry every footstep and conversation. Alexander's Pattern 21 (Four-Story Limit) notes that buildings above four stories lose human scale; churches achieve monumentality within this limit through proportion rather than height, a quality worth preserving.

Successful conversions share common strategies. The Church Brew Works in Pittsburgh inserted a brewing operation into the nave of St. John the Baptist Church (1902), placing fermentation tanks where pews once stood while preserving the altar, stained glass, and full ceiling height — the sacred volume remains legible while serving secular gathering. In Montreal, the conversion of Église Saint-Jude into 42 housing units (completed 2018) inserted a steel-framed mezzanine structure into the nave, creating two-story units that preserve sightlines to the original windows and ceiling from living spaces below. The key move: the inserted structure does not touch the perimeter walls, maintaining the reading of the original volume. In Edinburgh, the conversion of a redundant church into the Scottish Storytelling Centre (2006) preserved the main hall for performance while adding ancillary uses in side chapels and basement spaces.

**Therefore: when converting a church to community, cultural, or residential use, preserve the primary volume as a single readable space — the nave must remain legible from at least one major public or common area, even if other portions are subdivided. Insert new structure as freestanding elements within the shell, leaving at least three feet clear between new walls and original masonry to maintain thermal buffering and visual separation. Retain all original windows; if thermal performance requires improvement, add interior storm glazing following Heritage Retrofit (28) rather than replacing the glass. For housing conversions, insert mezzanine levels to capture upper volume without destroying it, following The Industrial Loft (141) proportions: minimum twelve-foot clear height in primary living spaces, minimum eight feet on mezzanine sleeping levels. Test the conversion against this criterion: a person standing in the main common space should be able to see the original ceiling, at least two original windows, and understand that this was once a church — if any of these three readings is blocked, the conversion has gone too far.**
