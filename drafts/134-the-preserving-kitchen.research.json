  "notes": "Unable to conduct web searches to verify evidence. Without search access, I cannot provide properly sourced citations for this pattern. The concept of preserving kitchens is well-established in traditional food cultures (particularly in cold climates with short growing seasons), but I cannot verify specific programs, statistics, or built examples without search capability. To properly research this pattern, searches should target: (1) community canning kitchen programs in Canada and Scandinavia, (2) food preservation extension programs from universities, (3) traditional Nordic/Japanese food preservation architecture, (4) food waste reduction statistics related to home preservation, (5) Edmonton-area community kitchen initiatives. Please grant web search permissions to complete this research."
