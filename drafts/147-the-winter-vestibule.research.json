  "notes": "Unable to conduct web searches due to permission restrictions. Cannot verify any claims with current sources. The concept of winter vestibules/arctic entries is well-established in cold climate architecture, but I cannot provide properly sourced evidence without web access. Building codes (such as ASHRAE 90.1 and IECC) do require vestibules for commercial buildings in cold climate zones, but I cannot confirm current specific requirements or cite studies. Please grant web search permissions to gather real evidence for this pattern."
