While I have general knowledge that mews housing exists (particularly in London where former stable lanes were converted to homes), I cannot provide verifiable citations, specific numbers, or sourced evidence without search capabilities. The pattern concept is historically valid but this research session produced no verifiable evidence. Please re-run with web search permissions enabled."
