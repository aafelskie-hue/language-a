# 119. The Bioswale Network [☆]

**…beyond Green Corridors (44) and Alexander's Green Streets (51)…**

**When rain falls on a neighborhood, it must go somewhere. If every lot handles its own water in isolation — a rain garden here, a permeable driveway there — the system works only at the edges. Heavy storms still overwhelm the street gutters that connect everything. Pollutants from roads still flow untreated into pipes. And the water that could replenish soil and support vegetation rushes past in minutes, leaving the land thirsty between storms. The lot-scale solutions are necessary but insufficient; what's missing is the connective tissue that turns isolated infiltration into a continuous drainage landscape.**

The logic of connected bioswales follows from hydrology itself. Water flows downhill, and it flows through the lowest available path. A bioswale — a shallow, vegetated channel with gently sloped sides — intercepts this flow and slows it. Unlike a pipe, which accelerates water and delivers it unchanged to the outfall, a bioswale detains water long enough for sediment to settle, for plant roots and soil microbes to process nutrients and pollutants, and for infiltration to reduce the total volume reaching downstream.

Portland, Oregon, pioneered the integration of bioswales into public streets through its Green Streets program beginning in the late 1990s. The SW 12th Avenue Green Street project, completed in 2005, demonstrated that a series of bioswales along a single block could reduce stormwater runoff by approximately 70% during typical rain events. Philadelphia's Green City, Clean Waters plan, launched in 2011, committed to greening 10,000 acres of impervious surface over 25 years, relying heavily on networked bioswales along streets and in public spaces. The city's monitoring data through 2020 showed measurable reductions in combined sewer overflows in neighborhoods with concentrated green infrastructure investment.

The network matters more than any single swale. A lone bioswale in a parking lot filters a small catchment. But bioswales connected along the grade of a street, each one receiving overflow from the one above it and discharging treated water to the one below, create a treatment train that can handle storm intensities far beyond what any single facility could absorb. This is the same principle Alexander recognized in his Green Streets pattern (51): that linear green space along roads serves multiple functions — beauty, ecology, climate, and water management — simultaneously. The bioswale network extends this by making water management the primary organizing principle, with the other benefits following from it.

In cold climates like Edmonton's, bioswales face real constraints. Frozen ground cannot infiltrate. Salt and sand from winter road maintenance accumulate in the swales and must be removed each spring. The growing season for the plants that do the biological work is short. Yet cities as cold as Minneapolis and Stockholm have implemented successful bioswale networks by designing for these conditions: deeper gravel reservoirs to store snowmelt below the frost line, salt-tolerant plant species, annual maintenance protocols timed to spring thaw. The swale works differently in winter — storing rather than infiltrating — but it still keeps water out of the pipes and provides treatment capacity when temperatures rise.

**Therefore: connect every rain garden, parking lot, and street in the neighborhood with a continuous network of vegetated swales that follow the natural grade. Size each swale to detain the runoff from a 25mm storm event within its drainage area. Space swales no more than 200 meters apart along the flow path, so that water never travels far over impervious surface before entering the vegetated system. Plant swales with deep-rooted native grasses and sedges that tolerate both standing water and seasonal drought. The test: during a moderate rainfall, water should be visible in the swale system for at least two hours after the rain stops — flowing slowly, pooling briefly, and disappearing into the ground rather than rushing to the storm drain.**
