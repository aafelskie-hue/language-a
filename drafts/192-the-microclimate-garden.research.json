The underlying concept (trees/vegetation reducing heat through shade and evapotranspiration) is well-established in urban heat island literature from EPA, NASA, and academic sources, but I cannot provide specific verified citations without search access. Key sources to investigate: EPA Heat Islands program, USDA Forest Service urban forestry research, and academic journals like Urban Climate and Building and Environment.
