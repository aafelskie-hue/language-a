# 207. The Embodied Carbon Audit [★]

**…beyond The Adaptive Reuse District (203), The Adaptive Reuse Toolkit (138), and Heritage Retrofit (28)…**

**When a building reaches the end of its current use, the decision to demolish or renovate is often made on operating costs alone — energy bills, maintenance, lease rates. But this accounting ignores the carbon already locked in the existing structure: the emissions from mining, manufacturing, transporting, and assembling every beam, brick, and pane of glass. Without a way to weigh what's already been spent against what new construction would cost, buildings are torn down when keeping them would release less carbon into the atmosphere.**

The Preservation Green Lab's 2011 study "The Greenest Building: Quantifying the Environmental Value of Building Reuse" compared the lifecycle carbon impacts of renovation versus new construction across six building types in four U.S. climate zones. Their finding: it takes 10 to 80 years for a new energy-efficient building to overcome the carbon deficit created by demolishing an existing one and constructing its replacement. For a warehouse converted to multifamily housing, the break-even point was 42 years in Chicago's climate. A new building would need to operate for four decades before its efficiency savings offset the embodied carbon released in its creation.

The carbon stored in existing buildings is substantial. A 2020 analysis by the Carbon Leadership Forum found that embodied carbon typically accounts for 30 to 50 percent of a building's total lifecycle emissions over 60 years — and for high-performance new buildings, the ratio tips further toward embodied carbon because operating emissions have been reduced. In a 10,000-square-foot masonry building from 1920, the walls alone represent roughly 200 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent that has already been emitted. Demolishing it releases additional carbon from the process itself — diesel for excavators, trucking debris to landfills, crushing and sorting — while losing the chance to amortize those original emissions over a longer lifespan.

The London Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) published embodied carbon guidance in 2020 recommending that projects conduct whole-life carbon assessments before demolition decisions are made. Their methodology compares three scenarios: retain and retrofit, partial demolition with addition, and full replacement. The assessment includes carbon from materials (modules A1-A3 in lifecycle terminology), construction processes (A4-A5), replacements over a 60-year study period (B1-B5), and end-of-life treatment (C1-C4). LETI's benchmark for new construction is 500 kg CO₂e per square meter of floor area; a deep retrofit typically achieves 100 to 200 kg CO₂e per square meter. The difference — 300 to 400 kg for every square meter retained — is carbon that never enters the atmosphere.

The audit is not an argument that every building must be saved. Some structures have structural failures that make retention genuinely impractical. Some contain materials — asbestos, lead paint, PCB-laden caulk — whose removal costs more carbon than demolition. The audit is a way of making these trade-offs visible rather than defaulting to the assumption that new is better.

**Therefore: before any demolition permit is issued, require a whole-life carbon comparison of three scenarios — full retention with retrofit, partial retention with addition, and full replacement. Calculate embodied carbon using lifecycle assessment methodology (EN 15978 or equivalent) across a 60-year study period. Include the carbon cost of demolition itself, not only the new materials. A project should proceed with demolition only when the replacement building's total lifecycle carbon — embodied plus operational — will be lower than retention within 30 years, or when retention is structurally infeasible as certified by a licensed engineer. Post the completed audit publicly before the permit decision.**
