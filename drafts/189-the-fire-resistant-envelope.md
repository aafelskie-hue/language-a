# 189. The Fire-Resistant Envelope [☆]

**…beyond Defensible Space (Wildfire) (18), The Firebreak Landscape (188), and The Sheltering Roof (37)…**

**When buildings sit in fire-prone landscapes, the envelope faces two masters: the desire for warmth, texture, and honest materials that age well — wood siding, cedar shakes, timber eaves — and the physics of ignition, where a single ember lodged in a vent or tucked against a combustible wall can destroy in hours what took years to build.**

The fire does not arrive as a wall of flame. It arrives as a blizzard of embers, some still glowing, carried kilometers ahead of the fire front on hot, erratic winds. These embers land on roofs, collect in gutters, blow through attic vents, and settle against siding. If they find fuel, they smolder; if they find oxygen, they ignite. Post-fire surveys consistently find that most structure losses in the wildland-urban interface come not from direct flame contact but from ember intrusion and radiant heat — the house ignites from the inside out or from small ignitions at vulnerable details.

California Building Code Chapter 7A, developed after repeated catastrophic WUI fires, establishes ignition-resistant construction standards: Class A fire-rated roofing, non-combustible or ignition-resistant exterior walls within specified distances, ember-resistant vents with 1/8-inch or smaller mesh, and enclosed eaves. The IBHS Wildfire Prepared Home program builds on this with whole-structure testing, subjecting mock buildings to ember showers and radiant heat panels to identify weak points. Their findings emphasize that fire resistance is not one material but a system — the roof matters little if embers enter through the soffit, and a concrete-fiber siding fails if it meets a wooden deck that carries fire to the wall.

This creates a tension with patterns like Honest Materials (56) and Living Surfaces (47), which rightly celebrate wood, timber, and natural materials that reveal their making and improve with age. The answer is not to abandon these values but to locate them correctly. Fire resistance is most critical at the outer envelope — the roof, the siding, the vents, the eaves, the first five feet. Interior surfaces, protected by the envelope, can still be wood, lime plaster, exposed timber. The envelope earns the right to an honest interior.

The materials that resist fire are not necessarily ugly or false. Fiber-cement siding is not pretending to be wood; it is cement and cellulose, and it can be installed to show its own logic of overlap and joint. Metal roofing — steel, aluminum, copper — is among the most honest of materials, requiring no paint, aging to its own patina, repairable with the same material. Stucco over non-combustible sheathing is lime and sand, ancient and fire-resistant. Stone and brick are self-evident. The test from Honest Materials still applies: can you repair this material with the same material? Metal, stucco, fiber-cement, and masonry all pass.

**Therefore: where wildfire risk exists, build the outer envelope entirely of non-combustible or ignition-resistant materials. Use Class A fire-rated roofing — metal standing seam, concrete tile, or fiber-cement shingles — and extend it over enclosed eaves that deny embers entry to the attic. Clad walls in fiber-cement, stucco, metal panels, or masonry, carried down to meet a non-combustible foundation zone at least 15 centimeters above grade. Screen all vents — soffit vents, gable vents, foundation vents — with 3-millimeter or smaller corrosion-resistant metal mesh. Where the roof meets the wall, where the wall meets the deck, where the vent meets the sheathing, detail for embers: no gaps, no cavities, no hidden channels where a glowing particle can lodge and smolder unseen. The test: inspect the envelope with a flashlight at night — any gap that admits light admits embers.**
