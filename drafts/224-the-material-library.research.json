This pattern topic (material reuse libraries, deconstruction programs, salvage centers) is well-documented in the circular economy and sustainable construction literature, but I cannot provide specific citations without search access. Known relevant organizations include: Habitat for Humanity ReStores, Build Reuse (formerly BMRA), various municipal deconstruction ordinances (Portland, San Jose, Milwaukee). Please grant WebSearch permission or provide source documents for me to extract verified evidence."
