# 235. The Permeable Paving [★]

**…beyond The Bioswale Network (119), Separated Stormwater (67), and The Permeable Lot (20)…**

**When a surface must bear weight — feet, wheels, parked cars — designers reach for asphalt or poured concrete because these materials are strong, cheap, and familiar. But sealed surfaces sever the connection between sky and soil. Every drop that falls on impervious paving becomes runoff: picking up oils and metals, heating as it crosses dark surfaces, rushing toward drains that cannot handle the peak flows. The lot needs to carry loads; the ground beneath it needs to drink. These demands seem opposed, but they are not.**

The conflict is real but the solution is old. Gravel roads and cobblestone streets infiltrated water for centuries before the age of asphalt. What modern permeable paving adds is engineered reliability: materials tested for load-bearing capacity, freeze-thaw durability, and infiltration rate. Permeable interlocking concrete pavers (PICP), for example, use precisely sized gaps filled with aggregate that allow water to pass through while the pavers themselves bear vehicular loads. The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association documents infiltration rates of 3–8 gallons per minute per square foot for pervious concrete — fast enough that standing water disappears almost as it lands.

Philadelphia's Green City, Clean Waters program, launched in 2011, committed to managing stormwater through green infrastructure across 10,000 acres over 25 years. Permeable paving was one of the primary tools, installed in parking lots, sidewalks, and plazas throughout the city. The program's goal: reduce combined sewer overflows by 85%, keeping raw sewage out of the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers. Chicago's Green Alley Program took a simpler approach — retrofitting the city's 1,900 miles of alleyways with permeable paving and reflective surfaces. These alleys, previously impervious ribbons draining directly to storm sewers, now absorb rainfall where it lands. The EPA includes permeable pavement as a best management practice in its national green infrastructure guidance, recognizing reductions in stormwater runoff of 70–90% compared to conventional surfaces.

The key to success lies in the base. Permeable paving fails not at the surface but below it — when the aggregate base clogs with sediment or the underlying soil cannot absorb the water delivered to it. A well-designed system includes a reservoir layer of open-graded stone beneath the pavers, sized to detain the design storm while water slowly infiltrates into native soil. In clay-heavy soils like those common in Edmonton, this reservoir may need to hold water for 24–72 hours; an underdrain can carry excess to the bioswale network when infiltration alone is too slow. The surface must also be maintained — vacuumed or pressure-washed annually to clear fine particles from the joints.

Alexander did not write a pattern for permeable paving — his Pattern Language predates the modern stormwater crisis. But his instinct was correct: Pattern 168 (Connection to the Earth) insists that buildings should touch the ground lightly, allowing water and life to pass. Permeable paving is the construction detail that makes this possible where hard surfaces are required.

**Therefore: wherever paving must support pedestrian or light vehicular traffic — driveways, parking areas, patios, walkways — use permeable materials: interlocking pavers with aggregate-filled joints, pervious concrete, or reinforced grass systems. Beneath the surface, install a reservoir base of open-graded stone at least 150mm deep. Size the reservoir to detain a 25mm rainfall event. In soils with infiltration rates below 15mm per hour, add an underdrain connected to the bioswale network. The test is simple: pour a bucket of water on the finished surface. It should disappear within thirty seconds, leaving no puddle. If water pools, the joints are clogged or the system is failing.**
