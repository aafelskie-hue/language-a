# 147. The Winter Vestibule [☆]

**…beyond The Heated Threshold (59), The Entrance Sequence (35), and The Micro-Mobility Lane (256)…**

**When the front door opens directly into the living space, two forces collide: the need to shed winter's burden — boots caked with snow, parkas stiff with cold, mittens dripping with melt — and the need to keep the home's warmth intact. Every entry becomes an invasion. Cold air floods the room, slush pools on the floor, and the ritual of undressing happens in the space meant for living.**

In Edmonton, the exterior door opens onto -30°C air for roughly 100 days each winter. Opening a standard 36-inch door for just ten seconds admits approximately 15 cubic feet of freezing air — enough to drop a small room's temperature noticeably and force the heating system to respond. In homes without vestibules, this thermal assault happens with every arrival, every departure, every child running back for forgotten mittens.

The arctic entry — known as the vestibule, mudroom, or cold porch — is an ancient solution, found wherever winters are severe. Traditional Inuit cold-trap entries used offset passages to prevent wind penetration. Scandinavian farmhouses placed the entry hall between the stable and the living quarters, so that the warmth of animals tempered the arriving cold. The principle is simple: create a thermal airlock, a space small enough to heat quickly and large enough to accomplish the work of winter transition.

ASHRAE Standard 90.1 requires vestibules for commercial buildings in Climate Zones 4-8 (Edmonton is Zone 7A) when the door serves an area larger than 3,000 square feet — a tacit acknowledgment that the energy penalty of unprotected entries is substantial. The International Energy Conservation Code extends similar requirements. Yet residential codes rarely mandate what every northern culture has discovered independently: the space between outside and inside must be its own room.

The vestibule's purpose is not merely thermal. It is the room where you transform from outdoor creature to indoor inhabitant. Boots must come off before crossing the threshold — this requires a bench, a place to sit, hooks within reach. Coats must hang where they can drip and dry — this requires space above a floor that tolerates water. Snow must fall somewhere — this requires hard flooring, a drain, or a mat system that can be cleaned. The vestibule earns its space by doing this work in a contained volume, rather than spreading winter's detritus throughout the home.

Alexander's Pattern 130, Entrance Room, recognizes that "the entrance room is a kind of transition between the world outside and the world inside." But in northern climates, this transition has physical weight. The vestibule is not an aesthetic choice — it is the difference between a home that stays warm and a home that fights the cold at every opening.

**Therefore: enclose the main entry of every cold-climate dwelling in a vestibule of at least 2.5 square meters (27 square feet) of floor area, bounded by two doors that are never open simultaneously. Include: a bench for seated boot removal, at least 0.5 meters of coat-hanging space per regular occupant, hard flooring that tolerates snow-melt, and either a floor drain or removable mats. The vestibule passes the airlock test: with the exterior door open, no line of sight exists to heated living space.**
