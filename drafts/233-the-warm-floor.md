# 233. The Warm Floor [★]

**…beyond The Heated Threshold (59) and The Radiant Floor (196)…**

**When floors are uninsulated — slab-on-grade without foam beneath, joists over crawlspaces with nothing but air below — heat drains continuously into the earth while feet grow cold on surfaces that never warm. The thermostat reads 21°C but the floor measures 14°C, and the body knows the difference. You add socks, then slippers, then rugs, then you avoid certain rooms in January altogether. The envelope is incomplete where it touches the ground.**

The floor is the largest horizontal surface in any dwelling, and the one in constant contact with the coldest mass — the earth. While outdoor air temperature in Edmonton swings from -35°C to +30°C across the year, soil temperature at one meter depth holds steady near 5°C. An uninsulated concrete slab sitting on that soil becomes a 5°C radiator in winter, pulling heat from the room above and conducting it endlessly into the ground. The Passive House Institute's research on slab-on-grade construction found that uninsulated slabs account for 15–25% of total building heat loss in well-insulated houses — the better the walls and roof, the more the floor dominates the thermal picture.

Human thermal comfort is asymmetric. P.O. Fanger's foundational thermal comfort research at the Technical University of Denmark established that floor surface temperature affects perceived comfort more than air temperature for seated or stationary occupants. ASHRAE Standard 55 specifies a floor surface temperature range of 19–29°C for thermal comfort; below 19°C, occupants report cold feet regardless of air temperature. At 14°C — typical for an uninsulated slab in winter — the floor is measurably uncomfortable. The body compensates by raising the thermostat, which stratifies warm air at the ceiling while feet remain cold. Energy is wasted heating air that rises away from the people it's meant to serve.

The solution is simple physics: interrupt the conductive path from floor to earth. Rigid insulation — extruded polystyrene (XPS) or expanded polystyrene (EPS) — placed beneath the slab and extending down along the slab edge creates a thermal break that keeps floor surfaces warm. The 2020 National Building Code of Canada requires R-10 under slabs in Climate Zone 7A (Edmonton's zone), but this is a minimum calibrated to cost recovery, not comfort. The Passive House standard specifies R-30 to R-40 under slabs for heating-dominated climates, bringing floor surface temperatures within 3°C of room air temperature. At this level, the floor becomes a comfortable surface rather than a heat sink — warm enough to sit on, warm enough that radiant floor heating systems can operate at low water temperatures, warm enough that children can play on it in winter without a rug.

For crawlspaces, the calculation differs: insulation can go either beneath the floor joists (creating an unconditioned crawlspace) or on the crawlspace walls and ground (creating a conditioned crawlspace). Building Science Corporation's research on crawlspace assemblies in cold climates favors the conditioned approach — insulating the perimeter walls to R-20 minimum, sealing the crawlspace to outdoor air, and laying continuous vapor barrier and at least 50mm of rigid insulation over the earth floor. This eliminates the cold floor problem while preventing moisture issues that plague ventilated crawlspaces in humid or cold climates.

**Therefore: under every slab-on-grade floor, place continuous rigid insulation — at least R-20 beneath the slab and R-10 along the slab edge, with no thermal bridges at footings or penetrations. For crawlspaces, either insulate between floor joists to R-30 minimum with a careful air barrier, or condition the crawlspace by insulating perimeter walls to R-20 and covering the earth floor with vapor barrier and rigid foam. Test the result: in winter, when outdoor temperature is -20°C and indoor air is 21°C, the floor surface should measure at least 18°C. If you can feel the cold through your socks, the insulation is inadequate.**
