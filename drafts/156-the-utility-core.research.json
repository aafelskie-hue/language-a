  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - no access to WebSearch or WebFetch tools was granted. The utility core concept is well-established in architectural practice (commonly seen in high-rise buildings, hospitals, and commercial structures), but I cannot provide verified citations without search access. Known examples from my training include: Seagram Building (1958) which pioneered the central core concept in modern architecture, and Louis Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories (1965) which separated 'served' and 'servant' spaces. However, I cannot verify current statistics, recent programs, or specific measurable outcomes without web access. To complete this research properly, please grant WebSearch permissions."
