# 169. The Demountable Partition [★]

**…beyond The Convertible Floor Plan (115), The Repaired Building (49), and The Permanent Frame (Alexander 205)…**

**When interior walls are built like exterior walls — studs nailed to plates, drywall screwed and taped, outlets hard-wired into cavities — the layout becomes permanent. A family that grows cannot add a bedroom. A family that shrinks cannot open a wall to gain light. Two units cannot merge when the market demands larger flats, nor subdivide when it demands smaller ones. The building's structure may last a century, but its interior freezes at the moment of construction, and every future change requires demolition.**

Stewart Brand, in *How Buildings Learn* (1994), identified the "space plan" — interior walls, partitions, furniture placement — as one of six building layers with its own distinct lifespan: three to thirty years, vastly shorter than the structure that contains it. The Dutch architect John Habraken arrived at the same insight from the opposite direction. His 1961 book *Supports: An Alternative to Mass Housing* argued that mass housing failed precisely because it entangled the permanent (the building's frame) with the personal (the occupant's layout). His solution — physically separate the "support" from the "infill" — has been tested across the Netherlands and Japan for over sixty years. In Japan's SI (Skeleton-Infill) housing, the structural frame is concrete; the interior partitions are lightweight, demountable systems that residents can reconfigure without touching structure. Osaka's Next21 experimental building, completed in 1994, was designed so that every unit could be replanned without affecting neighbors — and has been reconfigured repeatedly in the thirty years since.

The practical requirements are specific. A demountable partition must carry no building loads — neither gravity nor lateral. It must be removable without damaging the floor below or ceiling above, which means mechanical fasteners, not adhesive bonds, and base channels that sit on the floor finish rather than being embedded in the slab. Electrical and data must route through a separate chase — a raised floor, a perimeter raceway, a ceiling plenum — not through the partition cavity, or the wire becomes the reason the wall cannot move. Acoustic performance is the hard constraint: a removable wall that transmits conversation is no wall at all. The modern demountable systems — steel-stud frames with friction-fit connections, gypsum panels seated in gasketted tracks, full-height glass with aluminum mullions — achieve STC ratings of 42 to 50, comparable to conventional drywall construction.

The geometry matters. A demountable system works only when the structural grid permits it. A column at 6-meter intervals allows layouts in whole-meter increments. A column at 5.4 meters does not divide evenly and forces awkward corner conditions. The floor-to-ceiling height must be consistent — no dropped soffits that block partition paths, no raised slabs that interrupt base tracks. The zones where partitions may land should be coordinated at design stage: a "planning grid" — typically 600mm or 900mm in Europe, 2-foot or 4-foot in North America — overlaid on the structural grid, aligning with door widths, panel widths, and electrical outlet spacing.

**Therefore: design interior partitions as a system separate from structure, removable without demolition. Use non-load-bearing framing with mechanical fasteners — screwed connections or friction-fit tracks — instead of nailed and taped construction. Route all electrical, data, and plumbing through accessible chases (raised floor, ceiling plenum, perimeter raceway) rather than through partition cavities. Specify panels that can be unclipped, stored, and reinstalled: full-height demountable gypsum, modular glass, or relocatable panel systems. Coordinate the planning grid — 600mm or 900mm module — with structural columns, door widths, and outlet spacing so that any layout is achievable in whole-module increments. Test: a two-person crew should be able to remove a partition, relocate it to a new position on the planning grid, and restore electrical service in a single working day, with no patching, no mudding, and no repainting.**

**…this pattern connects to The Tool Wall (107), enabling occupants to make minor adjustments themselves, and extends upward to The Convertible Floor Plan (115), which orchestrates demountable partitions into a complete spatial strategy…**
