While I have general knowledge about seasonal festivals (Edmonton's Deep Freeze, Ice on Whyte, Scandinavian Midsummer traditions, Sapporo Snow Festival, etc.), I cannot provide the specific verified citations, URLs, attendance figures, and academic sources required by this research brief. Please either: (1) grant web search permissions, or (2) provide source documents for me to analyze, or (3) accept that this pattern requires external research to properly evidence."
