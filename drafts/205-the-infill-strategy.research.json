To properly research this pattern, I would need access to search tools to find: (1) EPA Smart Growth resources on infill development, (2) Urban Land Institute case studies, (3) academic research on infrastructure cost comparisons between infill and greenfield development, (4) municipal infill incentive programs like Portland's infill design standards, Denver's accessory dwelling unit policies, or Minneapolis's zoning reforms. Based on my training knowledge, infill development IS a well-documented urban planning strategy with substantial evidence, but I cannot provide verifiable citations without search access. Please re-run this query with web search permissions enabled."
