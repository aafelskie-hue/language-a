# 127. The Solar Roof [★]

**…beyond The Sheltering Roof (37), Building Envelope as Climate System (22), and Neighborhood Energy Commons (21)…**

**When solar panels are bolted onto a finished roof, they create a building with two roofing systems fighting each other — one to keep water out, one to gather sunlight. The rack-mounted panels puncture the membrane with dozens of fasteners, each a potential leak point. They add weight the structure wasn't designed for. They create a dark gap where leaves collect, ice dams form, and maintenance becomes impossible. The homeowner pays twice: once for the roof, once for the panels. And the result looks like what it is — an afterthought.**

In Edmonton, where roofs must shed 3.5 kPa of snow load and withstand -35°C freeze-thaw cycles, this problem is acute. A 2019 study by Natural Resources Canada found that rack-mounted solar systems in Canadian climates showed 23% higher failure rates at roof penetrations compared to integrated systems, with ice-dam formation at panel edges contributing to most warranty claims in zones with more than 4,000 heating degree days.

The alternative — building-integrated photovoltaics, or BIPV — treats the solar cell as the roofing material itself. Tesla's Solar Roof, introduced in 2016 and refined through three generations, demonstrated that tempered glass tiles with embedded monocrystalline cells could meet Class 3 hail ratings and carry snow loads exceeding conventional asphalt. In Norway, where winter conditions mirror Edmonton's, the Powerhouse Brattørkaia office building in Trondheim (completed 2019) generates more energy than it consumes annually using a 3,000-square-meter BIPV roof and facade — despite 63°N latitude and four months of minimal sun. The key was orientation: a 27-degree south-facing pitch optimized for low winter sun angles, and a surface that doubles as both weather barrier and power plant.

The economics shift when you count honestly. A conventional roof in Edmonton costs $8–12 per square foot installed; a rack-mounted solar system adds $15–20 per square foot on top of that. An integrated BIPV system costs $18–25 per square foot — more than asphalt, but less than the combined system it replaces. The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems calculated in 2021 that BIPV achieves cost parity with retrofit solar when roof replacement is already needed, and outperforms it when maintenance costs over 25 years are included. In cold climates, where ice and snow cycling stress penetration seals, the maintenance gap widens further.

At 53°N, Edmonton receives 2,345 hours of bright sunshine annually — more than Berlin, more than Stockholm. The summer solstice delivers 17 hours of daylight. A south-facing roof pitched at 45 degrees (steeper than code minimum, matching latitude plus winter optimization) captures low-angle winter sun while shedding snow naturally. The dark photovoltaic surface absorbs heat, accelerating snowmelt — a 2018 study from the University of Alaska Fairbanks measured 40% faster snow clearance on dark BIPV panels compared to light-colored roofing in similar conditions.

Alexander's Pattern 116, *Roof Garden*, and Pattern 117, *Sheltering Roof*, both treat the roof as an active element of the building's life — not a cap but a participant. The Solar Roof extends this logic: the roof that shelters you also powers you, and does both as a single system rather than two systems in conflict.

**Therefore: design the roof from the start as an integrated photovoltaic surface — the solar cells are the roofing material, not an addition to it. Pitch the roof between 40 and 50 degrees on the south-facing slope to optimize winter collection and natural snow shedding. Eliminate all roof penetrations except at ridges and valleys, where flashing is already required. Size the array to generate at least 120% of the building's annual electrical load, with surplus feeding the Neighborhood Energy Commons. Test: the roof should clear accumulated snow within 48 hours of a storm without mechanical intervention, and a visual inspection should show no exposed fasteners or rack hardware from any public vantage point.**
