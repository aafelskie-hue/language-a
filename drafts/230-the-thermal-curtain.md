# 230. The Thermal Curtain [★]

**…beyond The Operable Shading (197) and The Dark Season Room (61)…**

**Even the best triple-glazed window becomes a cold radiator during a long winter night. At -30°C, with seventeen hours of darkness, heat flows relentlessly toward the glass. You can feel it standing near the window — a subtle chill pulling at your body. The glazing that welcomed winter sun all afternoon now works against you, conducting warmth outward through the darkest hours. Yet the window must remain uncovered by day to capture every photon of precious winter light. The tension: maximum transparency when the sun is up, maximum resistance when it sets.**

The physics are unforgiving. A window with a U-value of 0.85 W/m²K — excellent by current standards — still loses roughly three times more heat per square meter than an R-40 wall. During Edmonton's coldest nights, when temperatures hold at -30°C for hours and the sun won't rise for sixteen of them, an uncovered window radiates heat continuously. The Passivhaus Institut in Darmstadt has measured the difference: interior window surface temperatures drop 3-5°C lower on uncovered windows than on those with insulated coverings, even with identical glazing. That temperature drop creates the cold downdraft that makes people avoid sitting near windows in winter — the very windows they need for winter sanity.

Traditional solutions understood this. Scandinavian farmhouses used wooden shutters, closed at dusk and sealed with felt weatherstripping. Russian izbas had double windows with the outer pane removed in summer — and heavy drapes drawn between them in winter. The settlers who built Edmonton's earliest frame houses hung quilts over windows at night, a practice that persisted into the 1950s in rural Alberta. These were not decorative choices. They were thermal necessities, born from the knowledge that a window's daytime gift becomes a nighttime liability.

Modern building science confirms what tradition knew. Insulated cellular shades with edge seals can reduce window heat loss by 40% according to testing by the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Heavy multi-layer curtains — quilted fabric with a reflective backing, sealed at the edges — perform similarly. The key variables are the R-value of the material itself (quilted curtains with batting reach R-3 to R-5), the completeness of the edge seal (gaps at the sides or bottom create convective loops that bypass the insulation), and the consistency of use (a curtain left open loses nothing). Interior insulating shutters, hinged or sliding, can achieve R-10 or higher when properly fitted and gasketed — approaching the performance of the wall itself.

The window seat created by The Deep Reveal (84) offers a natural mounting point. The reveal's depth — 200mm or more — provides space for the curtain to hang clear of the glass when open, and creates a sealed air pocket when the curtain closes against the reveal's face. In The Dark Season Room (61), where glazing is maximized for winter solar gain, thermal curtains become essential: the same south-facing glass that floods the room with December sunlight will hemorrhage heat through the sixteen-hour night that follows.

**Therefore: for every window larger than 0.5 m², install a thermal curtain, insulated shade, or interior shutter with an R-value of at least R-3. Mount it to seal against the window frame or deep reveal at all edges — top, bottom, and sides — using magnetic strips, Velcro, or compression seals. Close it at sunset and open it at sunrise. Test the installation by measuring the interior glass surface temperature one hour after closing the curtain on a night below -20°C: the air temperature in the pocket between curtain and glass should be at least 5°C warmer than an uncovered window of identical glazing. If you can feel cold air spilling from beneath the curtain, the seal has failed.**
