I have general knowledge about parking conversion trends (e.g., cities like Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Buffalo have reformed parking minimums; there are known examples like parking garage conversions), but I cannot provide specific citations, URLs, dates, or statistics without being able to verify them through search. Fabricating citations would be inappropriate. Please grant web search permission or provide source documents for me to analyze."
