# 197. The Operable Shading [★]

**…beyond Passive Solar Design (126), Seasonal Light Shift (86), and Neighborhood Energy Commons (21)…**

**When shading is fixed into the architecture — a permanent overhang, a static screen — it is optimized for one sun angle and wrong for most others. When shading is internal — blinds, curtains, drapes — the solar radiation has already passed through the glass and entered the thermal envelope; you are trapping heat inside the room while trying to block it. In Edmonton, where winter demands every photon of solar gain and summer can push unshaded rooms past 30°C, the choice between freezing in the dark and overheating in the light is a false one. What is needed is shading that moves — that opens wide to the low winter sun and closes tight against the high summer glare.**

Alexander addressed this in pattern 202, *Built-in Seats*, where he noted the value of window shutters for "controlling light and privacy." But he did not develop the thermal logic. The physics are simple and absolute: external shading blocks solar radiation before it reaches the glass, rejecting up to 80% of solar heat gain. Internal shading — even reflective blinds — can reject only 40-50%, because the radiation has already entered the room and converted to heat. The difference is not subtle. A west-facing window with internal blinds on a July afternoon in Edmonton (solar altitude 50°, ambient temperature 28°C) will contribute 400-500 watts of heat to the room. The same window with external louvers closed at 45° contributes less than 100 watts. One requires air conditioning; the other does not.

The traditional forms are well-known: the wooden shutters of Mediterranean farmhouses, the external venetian blinds (*Raffstoren*) standard in German and Austrian construction, the canvas awnings of Victorian porches, the operable brise-soleil of Le Corbusier's later work. What matters is that the shading element is outside the thermal envelope, that it can be adjusted by the occupant (manually or automatically), and that it can be fully retracted when solar gain is wanted. In cold climates, this last point is critical. A fixed external screen that blocks 60% of summer sun also blocks 60% of winter sun — and in Edmonton, where passive solar gain can provide 40% of a building's heating load on a clear January day (see Passive Solar Design, 126), this is an unacceptable loss.

The Vorarlberg region of Austria — latitude 47°N, comparable heating degree days to Edmonton — has developed a regional vernacular of timber-clad houses with full-height external sliding shutters. These shutters, typically vertical timber slats on a steel track, slide across the windows to shade summer sun and retract completely into wall pockets when winter sun is wanted. The mechanism is manual: a handle, a track, no motors. The shutters double as security, as privacy, as storm protection. They give the occupant direct, tactile control over the building's relationship to the sun — not a thermostat setting, but a physical action with immediate sensory feedback.

For east and west facades, where the sun angle is low and overhangs are ineffective, operable shading is not optional — it is the only passive strategy that works. A west-facing bedroom with no external shading will be uninhabitable on summer evenings. The same room with operable exterior louvers — angled to block sun above 30° while preserving the view — remains comfortable without air conditioning.

**Therefore: on every south, east, and west facade, provide external shading that can be fully opened and fully closed by the occupant. Use hinged shutters, sliding panels, retractable awnings, or adjustable louvers — mounted outside the glazing, on the exterior face of the wall. Size the shading to block direct sun when fully closed; design the mechanism to retract completely, leaving the glass unobstructed, when winter gain is wanted. The test: with shading deployed on a July afternoon, can you hold your hand against the inside of the glass without discomfort? If the glass is cool to the touch, the shading is working. If it is hot, the radiation is already inside.**
