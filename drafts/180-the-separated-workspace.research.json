To properly research this pattern, I would need to search for: (1) ADU/secondary suite policies in Edmonton and other cold-climate cities that permit home offices with separate entrances, (2) live-work zoning provisions in Canadian municipalities, (3) academic research on work-from-home spatial design and client-facing home businesses, (4) post-pandemic housing design studies addressing professional workspace separation. Without verified sources, I cannot fabricate citations. Please grant web search permission to complete this research task."
