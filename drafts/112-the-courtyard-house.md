# 112. The Courtyard House [★]

**…beyond The Courtyard Cluster (96) and South-Facing Living (38)…**

**When houses are simple boxes on lots, the perimeter rooms get light while interior rooms stay dark, and outdoor space is split between a public front yard no one uses and a back yard that feels like leftover land behind the house. The dwelling turns its back on itself. But when all rooms face outward to capture light from the street or the neighbors, privacy disappears — every window looks into someone else's window, and the yard becomes a stage. The tension: a house needs light in every room and private outdoor space for daily life, but the conventional lot offers light only at the edges and privacy only in the dark center.**

The courtyard house resolves this tension by turning the dwelling inside out. Instead of placing rooms around a dark core with windows facing outward to the property line, the courtyard house wraps rooms around a private open-air center. Every room can face inward, toward sky and garden, rather than outward toward the street or the neighbor's wall.

This is not a new idea. The courtyard house is among the oldest dwelling types on earth — found in the traditional houses of Morocco (the riad), China (the siheyuan), Rome (the domus), and the American Southwest (the hacienda). In Fez, courtyard houses have been continuously inhabited for a thousand years; in Beijing, siheyuan compounds sheltered families for twenty generations. What these traditions share is a spatial logic: the courtyard is not a leftover space but the generative center of the house, the room from which all other rooms take their light, their air, and their view.

Alexander recognized this in pattern 115 (Courtyards Which Live), arguing that a courtyard must be "somewhere between one-quarter and one-half the size of the building which encloses it" to feel neither cramped nor empty. He also insisted the courtyard be open to the sun on at least one side — in the Northern Hemisphere, typically the south. Contemporary research supports this proportion. A study of traditional courtyard houses in Seville by Rojas-Fernández et al. (2017) found that courtyards with a height-to-width ratio between 1:1 and 1:2 maintained comfortable temperatures through passive cooling, while narrower light wells overheated and wider courts lost the enclosure that made them feel like rooms. The courtyard works because it creates what Alexander calls "positive outdoor space" — a room open to the sky, shaped by the building around it.

In Edmonton's climate, the courtyard house is not the obvious choice — winters are long, and an open center loses heat. Yet the courtyard can still function if properly scaled and oriented. A south-facing court, sized generously enough to admit low winter sun, becomes a light well that illuminates north-facing rooms that would otherwise be dark. Glass walls or large sliding doors allow visual connection to the court even when outdoor use is impractical. In summer, the same court provides shaded outdoor space and natural ventilation. The key is treating the courtyard as a working part of the building's thermal and daylighting strategy, not as a Mediterranean fantasy dropped into the prairies.

**Therefore: when building a dwelling on a lot too narrow for side yards or too deep for light to reach the center, organize the house around a central courtyard open to the sky. Size the courtyard so that its area is at least one-fifth the footprint of the house, and its smallest dimension is at least four meters — large enough for a table, chairs, and a small tree. Orient the courtyard so that its longest open edge faces south, within 30° of true south. Give every primary living space — kitchen, living room, bedrooms — at least one window or door facing the courtyard. The test: stand in the center of the courtyard at noon on the winter solstice. If direct sunlight reaches the ground, the proportions are right. If every room around the court has light from two directions — one from the courtyard and one from the exterior — the house is alive.**
