  "notes": "Unable to search for evidence - web search permission not granted. This pattern concept (dedicated home digital archive systems) sits at the intersection of personal information management, digital preservation, and home technology design. Evidence likely exists from: Library of Congress digital preservation initiatives, academic digital curation research, data loss surveys from backup companies (Backblaze, Carbonite), and studies on personal archiving behavior. However, without search access, I cannot verify specific citations. The pattern itself addresses a real problem (data loss vulnerability) but architectural/spatial design responses to it may have limited formal study. Recommend granting web search permission for proper evidence gathering."
