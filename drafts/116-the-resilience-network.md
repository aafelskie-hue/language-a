# 116. The Resilience Network [★]

**…beyond The Third Place Network (2), Neighborhood Energy Commons (21), and Participatory Budgeting Space (51)…**

**When extreme weather strikes — a polar vortex that drops temperatures to -40°C, a derecho that fells ten thousand trees, a heat dome that kills the vulnerable in their apartments — communities face an impossible choice: either every household must maintain its own backup power, water reserves, and emergency supplies (which the poor, the elderly, and the renters cannot afford), or everyone depends on centralized emergency services that are overwhelmed precisely when they are needed most. The forces pull apart: resilience requires redundancy, but redundancy at the household scale is expensive; centralized shelters provide economy of scale, but they separate people from their neighbors, their medications, their pets, their dignity.**

Edmonton knows this tension intimately. The February 2021 polar vortex pushed ATCO's natural gas system to 97% capacity as temperatures hit -42°C; a single major line failure would have left tens of thousands without heat in lethal cold. During the 2023 wildfire season, when smoke from northern fires pushed the Air Quality Health Index above 10+ for days, residents with respiratory conditions had nowhere to go — most buildings lack filtered air, and the city's cooling centers were not designed for smoke refuge. The city's Emergency Management Agency operates warming centers and cooling centers, but these are reactive, centralized, and institutional — gymnasiums and recreation centers pressed into emergency service, not places you would walk to in your neighborhood.

The resilience hub model offers an alternative. Baltimore's Community Resilience Hub Network, launched in 2020 through the Baltimore Office of Sustainability, converts existing community centers, churches, and schools into year-round resilience infrastructure — each hub has backup power (typically 10-20 kW of solar plus battery storage), filtered air, water storage, and trained community members who know their neighbors. The hubs operate daily as community spaces (aligned with Third Place Network), building social connections that become emergency networks when crisis hits. Portland, Oregon's Neighborhood Emergency Teams (NETs) take a more distributed approach: trained volunteers, cached supplies in dozens of locations, and communication protocols that assume centralized systems will fail. Neither model is perfect for Edmonton's climate — Baltimore rarely sees -30°C, Portland's emergencies are earthquakes not blizzards — but both demonstrate the core principle: resilience works best when it is local, distributed, visible, and socially embedded.

The cold-climate version requires specific infrastructure. A resilience hub in Edmonton must maintain indoor temperatures above 15°C for at least 72 hours without grid power during a -40°C event — this demands serious insulation (R-40+ walls, R-60+ roof), thermal mass, and enough stored energy to run minimal heating. For a 200 m² community space, this means approximately 50-75 kWh of battery storage plus a backup heating source (propane, wood, or diesel) that does not depend on the electrical grid. The hub also needs potable water storage (4 liters per person per day for 72 hours for expected capacity), basic medical supplies, a communication system that works without cell towers (ham radio, satellite), and — critically — a roster of vulnerable neighbors who will need evacuation assistance. This is not a bunker; it is a community living room that happens to be survivable.

**Therefore: in every neighborhood of 2,000-5,000 residents, designate and equip at least one resilience hub — a community building, church, school, or purpose-built structure — capable of sheltering forty people for 72 hours without external power, water, or communication. The hub must be within a ten-minute walk of 80% of neighborhood residents. Equip it with: backup power sufficient to maintain 15°C interior temperature during a design cold event (-40°C for Edmonton); filtered air handling; potable water storage; basic medical supplies; and battery-powered communication. The hub operates year-round as a third place — a community center, a library branch, a clinic waiting room — so that residents know the space, know each other, and know who needs help when the power goes out. Test the system annually: run a 24-hour drill in January with simulated grid failure. If forty people cannot stay warm, fed, and informed, the hub is not ready.**
