  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - search and fetch tools are not available. This pattern concept (main-floor accessible bedroom/bathroom for aging in place) is well-established in housing policy literature, but I cannot provide verifiable citations without web access. Known relevant topics to research include: AARP Livable Communities initiatives, visitability ordinances (e.g., Pima County AZ, Atlanta GA), universal design standards, HUD accessibility guidelines, and academic research on aging in place. Recommend re-running this research task with web search permissions enabled."
