  "notes": "Unable to gather evidence - web search and fetch tools are not available/permitted in this session. The topic of designated snow storage landscapes with managed melt systems is a legitimate cold-climate design concern, and evidence likely exists from Nordic countries, Canadian municipalities, and northern US cities. To properly research this pattern, I would need permission to use WebSearch and WebFetch tools to access municipal snow management policies, EPA/Environment Canada guidelines, and academic research on urban snow hydrology. Without these tools, I cannot provide verified citations and must return empty results rather than fabricate sources."
