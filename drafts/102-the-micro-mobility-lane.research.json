  "notes": "Unable to verify evidence - web search and fetch permissions not granted. Cannot provide citations without ability to confirm sources. This pattern concept (speed-tiered micro-mobility lanes separating fast e-bikes from slower cyclists) is an emerging topic that would require real-time search to gather current policy examples and research. Known areas of activity include the Netherlands, Denmark, and some German cities, but I cannot cite specific programs, statistics, or studies without verification. Please grant web search permissions to complete this research task."
