# 202. The Constructed Wetland [★]

**…beyond Greywater Loop (65) and The Food Forest (132)…**

**When greywater from a building requires treatment before reuse, mechanical systems demand pumps, filters, and electricity — expensive to install, costly to maintain, and prone to failure when you need them most. Yet simply routing greywater to soil, as in a basic greywater garden, works only when volumes are modest and soaps are mild. Between the complexity of machines and the limits of direct dispersal lies a gap: the building that produces more greywater than a mulch basin can handle, but cannot justify the infrastructure of a treatment plant.**

The constructed wetland fills this gap. Unlike mechanical systems, it runs on gravity and photosynthesis. Unlike direct soil dispersal, it treats water before release, removing the soaps, greases, and pathogens that accumulate when flow exceeds what soil microbes can process. The treatment happens in the root zone of wetland plants — cattails, bulrushes, sedges — where bacteria colonize gravel and plant roots, breaking down organic matter and binding contaminants.

The numbers are robust. Kadlec and Wallace's 2009 comprehensive study of treatment wetlands documented BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) removal rates of 80–95% across hundreds of systems worldwide. Vymazal's 2011 review of five decades of constructed wetland research, published in *Environmental Science & Technology*, confirmed consistent pollutant removal across varied climates and scales. The energy comparison is stark: UN-Habitat's 2018 report on nature-based solutions found constructed wetlands require 85–95% less energy than conventional treatment — because plants and gravity do the work that pumps and aeration would otherwise perform.

The pattern has been built at scales from single buildings to entire developments. At BedZED in London, an 82-home development treats all wastewater through a Living Machine — a series of constructed wetland cells — reducing potable water demand by half. The Earthship buildings in Taos, New Mexico integrate indoor botanical cells where greywater flows through planted beds before returning to flush toilets. These are not experiments; they are functioning systems, some operating for decades. Arizona and Texas both authorize constructed wetlands for residential greywater treatment, with systems under 400 gallons per day exempt from permitting — a regulatory acknowledgment that the technology works.

The sizing is straightforward. A horizontal subsurface flow wetland needs roughly 2–5 square meters of planted bed per person, depending on water use. For a household generating 200 liters of greywater daily, this means 10–15 square meters of wetland — about the size of a small bedroom, laid flat in the yard. The bed is excavated 60 centimeters deep, lined to prevent groundwater contamination, filled with graded gravel, and planted with wetland species whose roots host the bacterial communities that do the actual treatment. Water enters at one end, flows slowly through the gravel matrix, and exits at the other — clarified, deodorized, and ready for subsurface irrigation or toilet flushing.

In cold climates, the pattern requires modification. Bacterial activity slows below 10°C and stops near freezing. A winter bypass valve routes greywater to the sewer during frozen months, while insulating mulch or a simple greenhouse cover extends the treatment season. This is not a year-round solution at 53°N — but from May through October, it handles the bulk of annual greywater flow.

**Therefore: where Greywater Loop (65) separates grey from black water and daily greywater flow exceeds 100 liters, construct a planted wetland basin sized at 2–5 square meters per occupant. Excavate 60 centimeters deep, line with impermeable membrane, fill with 20–40mm washed gravel, and plant densely with cattails, bulrushes, or native sedges. Route greywater to enter at one end through a perforated distribution pipe; collect treated effluent at the opposite end through a similar pipe set 5 centimeters above the liner. In cold climates, install a diverter valve to bypass the wetland when temperatures fall below 5°C. The test: water sampled at the outlet should show BOD below 30 mg/L and no detectable odor — clear enough that you would water tomatoes with it without hesitation.**
