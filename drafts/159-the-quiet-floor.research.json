I have general knowledge that building codes (IBC, HUD guidelines) require minimum STC 50 and IIC 50 ratings for floor-ceiling assemblies between dwelling units, and that resilient channel systems are common solutions, but I cannot provide properly sourced, verified citations without web access. Please grant WebSearch or WebFetch permissions to gather real evidence for this pattern."
