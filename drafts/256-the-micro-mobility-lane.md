# 256. The Micro-Mobility Lane [☆]

**…beyond The Mobility Hub (4), The Local Street (43), Safe Streets for Children (72), and The Winter City Street (58)…**

**When a single bike lane must serve both a parent pedaling a cargo bike at 15 km/h and a commuter on a speed pedelec at 45 km/h, neither rider feels safe. The fast rider weaves impatiently; the slow rider hugs the edge in fear. And when both are pushed onto sidewalks — as happens wherever dedicated infrastructure is absent — pedestrians become collateral damage in a conflict that belongs on the road.**

The electric revolution in personal transport has shattered the old assumption that "bikes" are a single category. A conventional bicycle travels 15–25 km/h. A Class 1 e-bike assists to 32 km/h. A speed pedelec — legal on Canadian roads — reaches 45 km/h. An e-scooter hovers around 25 km/h. A mobility scooter crawls at 10 km/h. These are not variations; they are different vehicles with different physics, different stopping distances, different rider expectations. Mixing them in a 1.5-meter painted lane creates the same chaos as mixing bicycles with motor vehicles — the problem bike lanes were invented to solve.

The Netherlands has begun to grapple with this. Dutch infrastructure guidelines now distinguish between "fietspad" (cycle path, typically 2.5 m) and "snelfietsroute" (fast cycle route, 4 m minimum, often separated into speed tiers). Copenhagen's Cykelslangen — the elevated "Bicycle Snake" — was designed wide enough for passing, but even at 4.6 meters, speed conflicts persist as e-bike adoption grows. The emerging consensus in northern European transport planning is that 45 km/h vehicles require infrastructure closer to a moped lane than a bike path: smoother surfaces, longer sight lines, gentler curves, and physical separation from slower traffic.

In Edmonton, the stakes are sharpened by winter. A cyclist at 15 km/h can navigate a lightly snow-packed trail. A speed pedelec at 45 km/h on the same surface is a crash waiting for a patch of ice. The heated bike lane — Pattern 103 — makes fast winter cycling viable, but only if the lane is wide enough and clear enough for speed. Mixing fast e-bikes with slow winter cyclists on a narrow heated path defeats the purpose of both. The geometry must separate by speed, not just by mode.

Alexander's Network of Paths and Cars (52) established the principle that pedestrians and vehicles require separate networks, not merely separate lanes on the same network. His Bike Paths and Racks (56) extended this to bicycles — but assumed a single class of human-powered vehicle traveling 15–25 km/h. The micro-mobility lane extends Alexander's logic to the new reality: where vehicle speeds differ by a factor of three, they belong on separate paths.

**Therefore: wherever a cycling route carries both conventional bicycles and speed pedelecs, divide it into two parallel lanes — a slow lane (15–25 km/h, minimum 2 m wide) and a fast lane (30–45 km/h, minimum 2.5 m wide), separated by a raised curb, painted buffer, or grade change. On heated routes, heat the fast lane first. At intersections, signal the fast lane separately and provide adequate stopping distance (minimum 25 m sight line at 45 km/h). The test: can a seven-year-old on a tricycle and a commuter on a speed pedelec use this route simultaneously without either changing their natural pace?**
