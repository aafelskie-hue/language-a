  "notes": "Unable to conduct web searches to gather verifiable evidence. External operable shading (brise-soleil, external venetian blinds, operable louvers) is a well-established passive design strategy documented in building science literature, but without web search access I cannot provide specific citations with URLs, exact statistics, or verified program details. This pattern concept is technically sound - external shading is demonstrably more effective than internal shading because it blocks solar radiation before it enters the thermal envelope - but I cannot fabricate citations to support it. Recommend re-running this research query with web search permissions enabled."
