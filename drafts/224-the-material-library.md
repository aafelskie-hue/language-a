# 224. The Material Library [☆]

**…beyond The Community Workshop (57), The Tool Library (91), and The Repair Café (92)…**

**When a building comes down, its materials go to the landfill — lumber still sound, brick still whole, doors and windows still functional. When a builder starts a new project, every material is purchased new: freshly milled wood, newly fired brick, hardware that has never turned a hinge. The embodied carbon of the demolished building is wasted; the embodied carbon of the new one is added to the atmosphere in full. And for the small builder, the owner-renovator, the community group on a limited budget, the cost of new materials puts good work out of reach.**

The Habitat for Humanity ReStore network operates over 900 locations across North America, diverting an estimated 100,000 tonnes of building materials from landfills annually. These are not junk shops — they are curated outlets for doors, cabinets, lighting fixtures, lumber, tile, and appliances donated by contractors, retailers, and homeowners. A 2018 study by the Building Materials Reuse Association (now Build Reuse) found that deconstruction — the careful disassembly of buildings to recover materials — salvages 70 to 90 percent of a building's material value by weight, compared to 20 to 30 percent for conventional demolition and recycling.

Municipal policy accelerates the shift. Portland, Oregon's 2016 deconstruction ordinance requires that homes built before 1916 be deconstructed rather than demolished, diverting materials to local salvage operations. San Jose mandates deconstruction for pre-1940 buildings. Milwaukee's deconstruction training program has graduated hundreds of workers and diverted thousands of tonnes of lumber, brick, and architectural elements from the waste stream. These programs create local jobs, reduce landfill burden, and make aged materials — Douglas fir timbers, clay brick, old-growth flooring — available at prices that undercut virgin equivalents.

The economics are specific. Old-growth dimensional lumber, unavailable new at any price, sells at salvage yards for less than new commodity framing. Reclaimed brick — denser and more durable than modern equivalents — costs 30 to 50 percent less than new handmade brick of similar quality. For the owner-builder working on a garage conversion, the community group renovating a church basement, the young family stretching a renovation budget, the material library transforms what is possible. And for the planet, every reused beam is embodied carbon preserved — carbon that was emitted decades ago, now amortized over another lifetime of service rather than released through demolition and landfilling.

Alexander did not write a pattern for salvage, but his THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE (253) gestures toward it: "Do not be tricked into thinking your house should be decked out with expensive furnishings... Use only things you really care for." The material library makes this possible for structure itself — the beam that framed someone's grandmother's house, the brick that weathered a century, the door hardware worn smooth by generations of hands. Materials with history carry meaning that new materials cannot.

**Therefore: in every neighborhood or district with active construction and renovation, establish a material library — a managed facility of at least 200 square meters where salvaged and surplus building materials are received, sorted, stored, and made available for purchase or free distribution. Stock it with dimensional lumber, doors, windows, hardware, cabinetry, brick, stone, tile, plumbing fixtures, and lighting. Price materials below new equivalents; offer free materials for community projects. Locate it adjacent to or within the community workshop. Staff it with at least one person who can advise on material quality, appropriate uses, and building code requirements. Accept materials from deconstruction contractors, retailers clearing inventory, and homeowners renovating. The test: a neighborhood material library is working when at least 20 percent of its inventory turns over each quarter, and when the small builder's first question is not "where do I buy this?" but "do they have one at the library?"**
