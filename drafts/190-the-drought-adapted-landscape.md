# 190. The Drought-Adapted Landscape [★]

**…beyond The Resilience Network (116) and The Water Budget (70)…**

**When a landscape depends on irrigation to survive, it becomes a liability in exactly the moments when water is most precious. During droughts, heat waves, or municipal water restrictions, the lawn that demanded daily watering turns brown and dies anyway — while the homeowner watches money and effort drain into a corpse. Yet the alternative seems bleak: gravel yards, plastic succulents, the aesthetic of abandonment. The forces pull apart: water conservation demands less irrigation, but human beings need gardens that feel alive, that flower and fruit and shelter birds, that reward the eye and the spirit through every season.**

The arithmetic is stark. A conventional lawn in a semi-arid climate requires 40 to 60 inches of supplemental water per year — roughly 25,000 gallons for a modest 1,000-square-foot lawn. In Las Vegas, the Southern Nevada Water Authority documented that replacing turf with desert-adapted landscaping reduces outdoor water use by 55 gallons per square foot annually. By 2022, their turf rebate program had removed over 200 million square feet of grass, saving an estimated 11 billion gallons of water per year. The gardens that replaced that grass are not moonscapes. They are courtyards of agave and desert willow, paths edged with flowering sage, shade from mesquite trees that need no irrigation once established.

The key is establishment versus maintenance. Native and drought-adapted plants require water to establish roots — typically two to three years of supplemental irrigation. After that, they survive on rainfall alone, or nearly so. The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, Texas, maintains demonstration gardens that receive no irrigation after establishment. Denver Water's Xeriscape Demonstration Garden, planted in 1988, uses 60 percent less water than a conventional landscape while remaining lush enough to attract 40,000 visitors annually. The plants are not merely surviving; they are thriving — because they evolved for the conditions they face.

Alexander's pattern 171, "Tree Places," calls for trees planted where they create social space, not merely decoration. But he wrote from California in the 1970s, before water scarcity became the defining constraint of western landscaping. The drought-adapted landscape extends his thinking: the tree must still make a place, but it must make a place without demanding water that isn't there. In Edmonton, this means selecting for cold-hardiness as well as drought tolerance — paper birch over weeping birch, bur oak over pin oak, saskatoon berry over blueberry. The plant palette changes with latitude, but the principle holds: choose plants adapted to the worst conditions your site will face, not the average conditions.

The edible landscape (25) and wildfire defensible space (18) both depend on this pattern. A fruit tree that requires daily watering in August will not survive a water restriction; a fire-resistant garden of gravel and natives will. The water budget (70) quantifies what this pattern makes possible: when outdoor irrigation drops to near zero, the household's total water demand may fall by half, and the cistern (136) can stretch through longer dry spells.

**Therefore: plant every landscape with species that require no supplemental irrigation once established — typically two to three years. Select native plants or regionally adapted species proven to survive on natural rainfall in your climate zone. Group plants by water need, placing the few that require irrigation (annual vegetables, container plants) in a single hydro-zone near a rainwater source. Test the landscape this way: if municipal water were shut off for sixty days in summer, would the permanent plantings survive? If yes, the landscape is drought-adapted. If no, replace the plants that would die. Allow no more than 20 percent of planted area to require supplemental irrigation after establishment.**
