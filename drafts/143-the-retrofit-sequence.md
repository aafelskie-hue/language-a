# 143. The Retrofit Sequence [☆]

**…beyond Heritage Retrofit (28), Building Envelope as Climate System (22), and the adaptive reuse patterns: The Mall Transformation (139), The Church Conversion (140), The Industrial Loft (141), The Schoolhouse Neighborhood (142), The Warehouse Conversion (204), and The Parking Conversion (206)…**

**When energy retrofits begin by replacing the furnace, the new equipment is sized for a building that still leaks heat through walls, attic, and windows. The oversized equipment cycles on and off inefficiently, the building wastes energy heating the outdoors, and within five years the owner adds insulation or windows — making the mechanical system even more oversized and the investment wasted. But when owners are told to do everything at once, they do nothing at all, because the cost is overwhelming. The sequence must be staged, and the stages must be ordered.**

The thermodynamics are unambiguous. In a typical 1970s Edmonton house, roughly 60% of heat loss occurs through the envelope: 25% through the attic, 15% through walls, 15% through windows, and the remainder through air leakage at penetrations and joints. Only after these losses are reduced can mechanical systems be properly sized. Canada's R-2000 program, launched by Natural Resources Canada in 1982, established the principle that envelope comes first: homes certified under the program achieve 1.5 air changes per hour at 50 pascals (ACH50), compared to 5–10 ACH50 in typical construction of that era. The program demonstrated that air sealing and insulation must precede mechanical upgrades, because you cannot size a heating system correctly for a building whose heat loss you haven't yet reduced.

Blower door testing confirms the sequence. A house tested at 8 ACH50 — typical for older Edmonton homes — loses 30–40% of its heating energy to infiltration. Seal the attic floor, rim joists, and penetrations first, bringing the house to 3 ACH50, and heating demand drops by 25–30% before touching the furnace. The required furnace capacity drops from 100,000 BTU to 70,000 BTU. The correctly-sized equipment runs longer cycles at higher efficiency, lasting years longer and using less fuel. The Saskatchewan Research Council's house-as-a-system studies in the 1990s and 2000s documented this relationship: envelope-first retrofits reduced total energy costs by 40–50%, while mechanical-first retrofits with leaky envelopes achieved only 15–20% savings.

The sequence also prevents moisture failures. In cold climates, installing a high-efficiency furnace in a leaky house increases the pressure difference that drives warm, humid indoor air into wall cavities and attics. The moisture condenses on cold sheathing and rots the structure from within. Air-sealing first — especially at the attic floor and rim joist — stops the airflow path before a new furnace amplifies it. The 2012 National Building Code of Canada recognizes this physics: buildings achieving less than 3 ACH50 must include mechanical ventilation (HRV or ERV) to replace the controlled air exchange that air sealing eliminated. The retrofit sequence mirrors the code logic: seal the envelope, then provide controlled ventilation, then size the heating system to the reduced load.

**Therefore: retrofit the building envelope before the mechanical systems, in this sequence. First, air-seal the attic floor, basement rim joist, and all penetrations — electrical boxes, plumbing stacks, duct boots. Second, insulate the attic to R-60 minimum. Third, insulate basement walls or upgrade windows, whichever is the larger remaining heat loss pathway. Finally, size and install mechanical systems based on the measured performance of the improved envelope. Test with a blower door before and after envelope work; target 3 ACH50 or lower in Edmonton's climate. Calculate heating load from the measured air leakage and insulation values. The new furnace or heat pump should be 30–50% smaller than the original equipment — if it isn't, the envelope work was incomplete.**
