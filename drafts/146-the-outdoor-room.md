# 146. The Outdoor Room [★]

**…beyond Positive Outdoor Space (36), The Sheltering Roof (37), The Healing Garden (33), and The Forest Bathing Path (208)…**

**When outdoor spaces are fully exposed to the sky, people retreat indoors at the first sign of rain, the first blast of wind, the first hot afternoon sun. But when outdoor spaces are fully enclosed, they become interiors — the air doesn't move, the seasons don't register, and the restorative power of being outside is lost. The tension: people need to be outdoors to feel well, but they need protection to stay there.**

Christopher Alexander identified this pattern as "Outdoor Room" (163), noting that people gravitate to places that are simultaneously open and sheltered — the space under a grape arbor, beneath wide eaves, inside a walled courtyard with a pergola overhead. His observation holds: the purely exposed terrace sits empty while the covered corner fills with chairs.

The evidence is behavioral and observable. Walk any neighborhood after a rain shower begins, and watch where people linger: under porch roofs, beneath pergolas, in gazebos. The Tucson firm Ibarra Rosano documented this in their courtyard houses, where deep portal roofs — twelve to sixteen feet — create outdoor rooms that residents use eight months of the year despite summer temperatures exceeding 40°C. The roof blocks direct sun while allowing reflected light and air movement. In the Pacific Northwest, Cutler Anderson Architects has built dozens of houses with covered outdoor rooms that extend living space through the nine-month rainy season — spaces that would be abandoned without overhead shelter.

The key dimensions emerge from practice. A roof alone is not enough: the 1994 study by Jan Gehl's firm documented that wind is the primary driver of outdoor discomfort in temperate climates. A space needs enclosure on at least two sides — preferably the windward sides — to feel sheltered enough for lingering. But enclosure on all sides kills the sense of being outside. The outdoor room succeeds when it is bounded enough to feel protected and open enough to feel connected to sky, garden, and weather. Alexander specified that the space should be at least six feet deep to feel like a room rather than a corridor, and at least partially open to sky — through a pergola, through gaps in the canopy, through translucent roofing material — so that light shifts through the day and rain can be heard overhead.

The floor matters as much as the roof. A concrete slab continuous with the interior floor reads as inside; a gravel floor or stepping stones through plantings reads as garden. The most successful outdoor rooms use a surface that acknowledges weather — flagstone with open joints, wood decking that accepts rain, brick that darkens when wet. You know you are outside because the floor tells you so.

In Edmonton's climate, the outdoor room is seasonal — usable from May through September, with shoulder-season use possible when oriented to catch afternoon sun and block prevailing northwest wind. The pattern is marked as not cold-climate-critical because the core need it addresses (protection from rain, wind, and sun while remaining outdoors) operates at its fullest in milder climates. But even here, a well-designed outdoor room extends the usable season by a month on either end.

**Therefore: at every dwelling, create at least one outdoor room — a space with a roof overhead, walls or dense planting on at least two sides, and at least one edge fully open to the garden or view. Size the room to hold a table and chairs for the household, minimum eight by ten feet in floor area. The roof may be solid (for rain protection) or permeable (pergola, lattice) depending on climate, but it must cast shade at midday. Test: stand in the center on a rainy or windy day. If you can sit comfortably without getting wet or wind-buffeted, and if you can still see the sky and feel the air move, the outdoor room is working.**
