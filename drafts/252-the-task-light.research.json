  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - no permissions granted for WebSearch or WebFetch tools. Task lighting is a well-established concept in lighting design with substantial professional literature (IES standards, DOE guidance, LEED credits for lighting power density reductions), but I cannot provide verified citations without search access. Known areas of evidence include: (1) IES Lighting Handbook recommendations for task-ambient lighting systems, (2) ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 lighting power density requirements, (3) GSA workplace lighting studies, (4) LEED v4 credits for lighting controls. Please grant web search permission to gather properly sourced evidence."
