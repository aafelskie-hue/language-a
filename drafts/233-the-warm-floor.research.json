This pattern requires web access to gather verifiable evidence about floor insulation programs, building codes, and research studies. The pattern concept is sound (floor insulation preventing heat loss and cold discomfort is well-established in building science), but I cannot provide specific citations without search capability. Please grant WebSearch and/or WebFetch permissions to complete this research task."
