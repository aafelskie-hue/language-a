  "notes": "Unable to search web sources to verify evidence. Cross ventilation is a well-established passive cooling strategy with substantial research literature, but without web access I cannot provide properly sourced citations. Known sources to check manually: ASHRAE Standard 62.1 (ventilation requirements), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory natural ventilation research, Building Science Corporation publications, and the Whole Building Design Guide (wbdg.org). Built examples likely exist at Bullitt Center (Seattle), BedZED (UK), and various Passive House certified buildings. This pattern likely has STRONG evidence when properly researched, but I cannot confirm without search access."
