  "notes": "Unable to verify evidence - web search and fetch permissions not granted. Green roofs/living roofs are a well-documented design strategy with extensive research (EPA, academic literature, municipal programs in Toronto, Copenhagen, and many European cities), but I cannot provide specific citations without the ability to verify current sources. This pattern likely warrants strong confidence (2 stars) once proper research can be conducted. Known policy examples that should be verified: Toronto Green Roof Bylaw (2009), Copenhagen green roof requirements, Germany's 50+ years of green roof research and incentive programs. Known research areas: GSA green roof studies, EPA stormwater management data, urban heat island research from various universities."
