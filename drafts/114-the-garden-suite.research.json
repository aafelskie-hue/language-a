  "notes": "CRITICAL: I was unable to perform live web searches to verify this information. The data above comes from my training knowledge (cutoff May 2025) and represents what I understand to be accurate from that period. All statistics and program outcomes should be verified through current government sources before use. The core pattern (garden suites as dignified secondary dwellings) has substantial policy support in multiple jurisdictions, but exact current numbers require live verification. I recommend running this research again with WebSearch permissions enabled."
