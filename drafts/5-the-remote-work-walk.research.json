  "notes": "Unable to conduct web searches to verify evidence. The concept of 'fake commutes' or walking routines to replace commuting has been discussed in workplace wellness discourse since the COVID-19 pandemic shift to remote work, but without search access I cannot provide verified citations, specific program names, or confirmed statistics. This pattern likely has moderate evidence available through proper research—the phenomenon is real and has been covered in organizational psychology literature—but I cannot fabricate sources. Recommend re-running this research with web search enabled."
