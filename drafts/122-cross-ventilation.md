# 122. Cross Ventilation [★]

**…beyond South-Facing Living (38) and Neighborhood Energy Commons (21)…**

**When windows are placed only for view, for light, or for architectural symmetry, rooms become still boxes in summer. Heat accumulates. The occupant's only recourse is mechanical cooling — which demands energy, which the neighborhood must generate or purchase, which fails during outages precisely when it is needed most. But when windows are cut through opposing walls to chase every breeze, the building may lose privacy, structural simplicity, or the quiet alcoves that make rooms feel protected. The tension is between airflow and enclosure.**

Air moves through a building when it has somewhere to go. A single window, no matter how large, creates only turbulent mixing near the opening; the back of the room stays hot and stagnant. Two openings on opposite or adjacent walls create a pressure differential — wind enters the high-pressure side and exits the low-pressure side, sweeping the room clean. This is cross ventilation, and its physics are simple: the rate of airflow depends on the pressure difference (driven by wind speed and direction), the size of the openings, and the resistance of the path between them.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 62.1 assumes a minimum outdoor airflow of 5 cfm per person for acceptable indoor air quality in mechanically ventilated spaces. A modest cross-ventilation path — two 0.5 m² openings on opposite walls in a 5 m/s breeze — can deliver 15–25 air changes per hour, far exceeding this baseline. Measurements at the Bullitt Center in Seattle, designed for natural ventilation, showed that operable windows provided comfortable conditions for 85% of occupied hours during the cooling season, eliminating the need for compressor-based cooling entirely. The building's windows are positioned to align with Seattle's prevailing southwest summer winds, with transom vents above interior doors to complete the airflow path.

The geometry matters. Research from the Florida Solar Energy Center found that staggering inlet and outlet windows — placing them on adjacent rather than directly opposite walls — can increase air movement within the room by 20–40%, as the diagonal path sweeps more floor area. Inlet openings should be low (where cooler air enters) and outlet openings high (where warm air naturally rises), reinforcing the stack effect described in Alexander's Pattern 107. In Edmonton's brief but intense summers, when afternoon temperatures reach 28–32°C and mechanical cooling is rare in older housing stock, a well-placed cross-ventilation path is often the difference between sleeping and not sleeping.

The Passivhaus Institut recommends that operable windows for ventilation total at least 1/30 of the floor area served, split between inlet and outlet. But area alone is insufficient without path. A 3 m × 4 m bedroom with a single 1.2 m² window on the west wall and a 0.4 m² transom above the door to an interior hallway (which itself connects to an operable window on the east facade) becomes a room that breathes. The same bedroom with only the west window becomes a room that bakes.

Alexander, in Pattern 107 (Wings of Light), argued that no building should be more than 25 feet deep if it is to be naturally lit and ventilated from both sides. This remains sound. Deep floor plates require mechanical systems; shallow floor plates allow cross ventilation to work. The pattern is not merely about placing windows — it is about building narrow enough that windows on two sides are possible.

**Therefore: in every occupied room, place operable windows or vents on at least two walls — ideally on opposite or adjacent walls aligned with prevailing summer winds. Size the total operable area to at least 1/30 of the floor area, split between inlet and outlet. Connect rooms to cross-ventilation paths with transom vents, louvered doors, or transfer grilles so that air entering one facade can exit another. Keep the building depth shallow enough — 10 meters or less — that no room is more than 5 meters from an exterior wall. Test: with windows open and a 3 m/s breeze, a tissue held at chest height in the center of the room should flutter.**
