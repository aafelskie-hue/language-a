I have general knowledge that smart water meters and consumption dashboards exist (e.g., Flume, Phyn, WaterSmart software, various municipal AMI programs), and I recall studies showing 5-15% water savings from real-time feedback, but I cannot provide properly sourced citations without the ability to search and verify current information. To complete this research properly, please grant permission to use WebSearch and/or WebFetch tools."
