  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - search and fetch tools not available. To properly research this pattern, I would need to search for: (1) Office pod/acoustic booth market research reports from Grand View Research, Mordor Intelligence, etc.; (2) Steelcase, Herman Miller, and other furniture manufacturers' workplace research on acoustic privacy; (3) Academic studies on open-plan office noise and productivity; (4) Specific products like Framery, Room, Zenbooth that have documented installation numbers. Known manufacturers include Framery (Finland), Room (US), Zenbooth (US), and others, but I cannot verify current statistics or outcomes without web access. The pattern itself addresses a real and growing need post-pandemic with hybrid work, but evidence must be gathered through proper research."
