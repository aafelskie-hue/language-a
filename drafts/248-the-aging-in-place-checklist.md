# 248. The Aging-in-Place Checklist [★]

**…beyond The Aging-in-Community Network (77) and The Lifetime Home (15)…**

**When housing is built only for today's body, each decade extracts its toll: the step that becomes a barrier, the bathtub that becomes a trap, the doorway that won't admit a walker. Either the house must be torn apart and rebuilt — at great expense, at the worst possible moment — or the person must leave. But when accessibility is treated as a special provision rather than a baseline, even well-intentioned builders resist: each feature seems like an extra cost for an unlikely future. The result is a housing stock that expels people precisely when they most need to stay.**

The tension is real. A developer building for first-time homebuyers sees no market demand for grab-bar blocking or zero-step entries. The buyers themselves, healthy at thirty-five, cannot imagine needing these things. And so the checklist goes unwritten, the walls remain unblocked, and the single step at the front door — just four inches — becomes, thirty years later, the reason someone loses their home.

Pima County, Arizona, resolved this in 2002 with the first visitability ordinance in the United States: every new single-family home must have at least one zero-step entrance, 32-inch clear-width interior doors, and a half-bathroom accessible on the main floor. The cost increase was measured at $100 to $600 per unit — roughly 0.1% of construction cost. The UK's Lifetime Homes Standard, developed in 1999 and mandatory for social housing until 2015, went further: sixteen criteria including reinforced bathroom walls, accessible switches and outlets, and space for a through-floor lift. When surveyed, 77% of adults over fifty told AARP they want to remain in their current home as they age. The checklist is not an imposition; it is what people actually want, built in from the start.

The arithmetic is unforgiving. A retrofit to widen doorways, add grab bars, and install a stair lift typically costs $10,000 to $50,000. A nursing home in Alberta costs $6,000 to $8,000 per month. A checklist applied during construction adds a few hundred dollars. The choice is not between "accessible" and "normal" housing — it is between paying now or paying catastrophically later. Scandinavian building codes have understood this for decades: Sweden requires step-free access and accessible bathrooms in all new multi-family housing, treating these not as accommodations but as basic building quality.

The Lifetime Home (15) establishes the underlying principle: every home should work for every body that might inhabit it. This pattern makes that principle operational — a list you can hold in your hand and check off before the drywall goes up.

**Therefore: establish a checklist of minimum accessibility features that every new dwelling must incorporate before occupancy. The checklist includes: (1) at least one entrance with no steps or a threshold no higher than ½ inch; (2) all interior doorways at least 34 inches clear width; (3) one full bathroom on the entry level with walls reinforced for grab bars at toilet and tub/shower; (4) all switches and outlets between 15 and 48 inches from the floor; (5) lever handles on all doors and faucets; (6) a clear path at least 36 inches wide connecting the accessible entrance to the accessible bathroom and to one sleeping area. Test: an inspector with a tape measure and a five-minute checklist can verify compliance before certificate of occupancy is issued.**
