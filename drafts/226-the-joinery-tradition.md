# 226. The Joinery Tradition [☆]

**…beyond Repair Culture (54), The Repaired Building (49), and Honest Materials (56)…**

**When wood members must be joined, nails and screws offer speed but betray the material. Metal fasteners split grain, corrode over time, and make disassembly a violence — pry bars, stripped heads, splintered ends. The connection that was fast to make becomes impossible to unmake. Yet pure joinery demands skills most builders no longer possess and time most budgets cannot afford. The tension: how to join wood so that the connection honors the material's nature — its grain, its movement, its capacity to be worked again — without requiring a master carpenter for every beam.**

The Japanese temple tradition demonstrates what is possible when joinery replaces fasteners entirely. Hōryū-ji, built in 607 CE near Nara, has stood for over 1,400 years through periodic disassembly, member replacement, and reassembly — a process called *kaitai shūri* (dismantling repair). The carpenters who maintain it work with the same joint geometries their predecessors cut fourteen centuries ago. When a beam decays, they remove it, shape a new member to the same profile, cut the same joints, and slide it into place. No fasteners to corrode. No adhesive to fail. The building is not preserved — it is continuously remade, piece by piece, across generations.

European timber framing followed a parallel logic. The barns and guild halls of medieval Germany used mortise-and-tenon joints secured with wooden pegs — *Fachwerk* construction that allowed frames to be disassembled, transported, and re-erected. When the Riesenhaus in Goslar required restoration in the 1990s, carpenters found that joints cut in 1494 could still be separated and reassembled. The pegs had shrunk slightly; the tenons had worn smooth; but the geometry held. Metal would have welded itself to wood through rust; glue would have failed or required destruction to separate. The wood-to-wood connection remained reversible after five hundred years.

Contemporary practice offers a middle path. The Timber Framers Guild, founded in 1984 and now comprising over 1,500 professional members across North America, has codified traditional joinery for modern applications. Their standards specify joints — housed dovetails, through-tenons, scarf joints — that can be cut with a combination of power tools and hand work by carpenters with focused training rather than decade-long apprenticeships. A housed dovetail connecting a joist to a beam, for instance, requires perhaps twenty minutes to lay out and cut with a circular saw, chisel, and mallet. The joint transfers load through geometry — the dovetail's angle locks against withdrawal, the housing's shoulder resists rotation — rather than relying on the shear strength of metal through wood fiber.

The advantage compounds over time. A nailed connection loses roughly 10-15% of its holding strength per decade as the wood cycles through seasonal moisture changes, swelling and shrinking around the rigid steel. After fifty years, the connection may retain half its original capacity. A properly fitted wooden joint, by contrast, grows tighter as the wood dries — the peg swells first and shrinks last, locking the tenon in place. The Timber Frame Engineering Council's span tables, developed in collaboration with the American Wood Council, account for this difference: joinery connections carry higher allowable loads at longer service life than equivalent metal-fastened connections.

**Therefore: wherever wood members join — beam to post, joist to beam, brace to frame — use interlocking joinery secured with wooden pegs rather than metal fasteners. Choose joints appropriate to the load: mortise-and-tenon for posts and beams in compression, dovetails for members in tension, scarf joints for lengthening timbers. Cut joints with a combination of power tools for rough shaping and hand tools for final fitting. Drive pegs of a harder wood — white oak pegs in softwood frames, black locust pegs in hardwood — through offset holes (drawboring) to pull the joint tight. The test: every major joint should be disassemblable by driving out its pegs and separating its members, without splitting wood or cutting metal, in under fifteen minutes by one person with a mallet and drift pin.**
