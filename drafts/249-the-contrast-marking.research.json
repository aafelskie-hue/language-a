  "notes": "Unable to gather evidence - web search and web fetch permissions not granted. I cannot fabricate citations. Known relevant standards likely include: ADA Standards for Accessible Design (US), UK Building Regulations Part M, ISO 21542 (Building accessibility), and Australian Standard AS 1428.1. These would require web access to verify current requirements and cite specific provisions. The pattern itself is well-established in accessibility practice, but I cannot provide properly sourced evidence without search capabilities."
