# 184. The Accessory Commercial Unit [☆]

**…beyond The Shopfront Dwelling (170) and Alexander's Individually Owned Shops (87)…**

**When zoning draws a hard line between residential and commercial, two failures emerge: the home business operates furtively — a hairdresser with no sign, a tailor with no street presence, a baker who cannot sell from the kitchen where she bakes — while the neighborhood lacks the small services that make daily life walkable. The entrepreneur cannot grow because visibility is illegal. The neighbors drive to strip malls because the corner lot cannot hold a café. Yet fully commercial ground floors overwhelm residential streets with traffic and scale. The tension is this: people need to earn their living from their homes, and neighborhoods need services within walking distance, but the presence of commerce must not erase the domestic character that makes the street a place to live.**

Alexander, writing in 1977, understood this. His pattern 87 — Individually Owned Shops — calls for businesses where the owner works behind the counter, lives nearby, and has a stake in the community. But he imagined these shops clustered in distinct commercial zones. What he did not foresee was the return of the cottage industry: the knowledge worker who receives clients, the craftsperson who sells from a workshop, the therapist who needs a waiting room separate from the family kitchen. These enterprises do not need a shopfront on main street. They need a room with a door to the sidewalk.

Portland, Oregon, has permitted accessory commercial uses in residential zones since its 2016 Residential Infill Project, allowing businesses up to 46 square meters in detached structures on single-family lots, provided they serve neighborhood-scale needs and employ no more than two non-resident workers. Minneapolis amended its zoning in 2020 to allow "home occupation with customer visits" in accessory structures, requiring only that the structure match the residential character of the block. Neither city has reported significant traffic complaints or enforcement actions; the businesses are simply too small to register as nuisances.

The form matters as much as the permission. A commercial unit attached to or within a laneway house (13) benefits from the lane's service access — deliveries arrive without crossing the front garden, and clients can park briefly in the lane without blocking the street. The commercial space faces the lane; the dwelling faces inward. This is the mirror image of the shopfront dwelling (170), which places commerce on the main street and domestic life above. Here, commerce is tucked behind, scaled to the lane, discovered by word of mouth rather than foot traffic.

The unit must declare itself without shouting. A sign — small, unlit, mounted flat to the wall — tells the passerby that this is a place of business. A separate entrance, distinct from the dwelling's, marks the threshold (5) between domestic and commercial life. The window should be generous enough to show the work inside — the potter's wheel, the consultation room, the rack of mended bicycles — without the full transparency of a retail shopfront. Inside, the space wants flexible fit-out (101): a sink that can serve a tea service or a darkroom, electrical capacity for tools, a floor that can be swept clean. Build it with materials that age well (104) — this is the first thing clients see, and it must look established, not provisional.

**Therefore: on any residential lot with lane access, permit a commercial space of no more than 50 square meters, either within a laneway house (13) or as a distinct ground-floor room facing the lane. Give it a separate entrance from the lane, a small sign (no larger than 0.2 square meters), and at least one window that reveals the interior activity. Require that the business owner reside on the same lot — this is the test that separates the accessory commercial unit from a rental storefront. Limit non-resident employees to two. Build with a permanent frame and changeable fit-out (101), so the space can shift from workshop to office to studio as the household's enterprise evolves. The unit passes when you can stand in the lane and understand, at a glance, that someone lives here and works here — and that both activities belong.**
