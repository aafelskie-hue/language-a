  "notes": "Unable to search the web to verify evidence. Web search and web fetch permissions were not granted. To provide accurate, sourced evidence for this pattern, I would need access to search for: (1) U.S. Department of Labor registered apprenticeship statistics, (2) Bureau of Labor Statistics data on construction trades, (3) Academic studies on apprenticeship outcomes, (4) Reports from organizations like the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER) or Associated General Contractors. Without web access, I cannot fabricate citations or statistics - that would violate research integrity. Please grant web search permissions and re-run this research task."
