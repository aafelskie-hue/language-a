This pattern likely has moderate to strong evidence in the biophilic design literature (water features are commonly studied for stress reduction, sound masking of traffic noise, and restorative effects), but I cannot provide verified citations without search access. Known research areas include: Roger Ulrich's work on restorative environments, studies on blue space and wellbeing, and sound masking research. Please grant web search permissions to gather verified evidence."
