# 183. The Co-Housing Cluster [★]

**…beyond House Cluster (Alexander 37)…**

**When housing is entirely private, each household must duplicate expensive, rarely-used spaces — the guest bedroom empty eleven months a year, the workshop that sits idle, the dining room too small for a real gathering. Yet when housing is entirely communal, privacy dissolves and autonomy suffers. The tension is this: people need both private sanctuary and shared abundance, but conventional development forces a choice between isolation with redundancy or community with intrusion.**

The cohousing model emerged in Denmark in the 1960s, when architect Jan Gudmand-Høyer designed Sættedammen, completed in 1972 near Copenhagen — twenty-seven private dwellings sharing a common house with kitchen, dining hall, workshops, and guest rooms. Residents own their individual units but jointly manage the shared facilities. The model spread: by 2023, Denmark had over 700 cohousing communities; the Cohousing Association of the United States counted 175 completed communities with another 140 in development.

The spatial logic is precise. Trudeslund, completed in 1981 in Birkerød, Denmark, clusters thirty-three dwellings around a central common house of 450 square meters containing a commercial kitchen, dining hall seating eighty, children's playroom, workshop, and two guest rooms. Individual units average 110 square meters — smaller than typical Danish single-family homes — because the common house absorbs functions that would otherwise require private space. A 2019 study by Vestbro and Horelli found that cohousing residents in Nordic countries reported 40% more frequent social contact with neighbors than residents of conventional housing, while maintaining equivalent satisfaction with privacy.

The common house is the heart. At Muir Commons in Davis, California — the first purpose-built American cohousing, completed in 1991 — the 370-square-meter common house sits at the center of twenty-six townhouses arranged along a pedestrian street. Residents share three common meals per week, prepared by rotating cooking teams in the commercial kitchen. A 2015 survey by the Cohousing Research Network found that communities with a common house of at least 10 square meters per household reported higher participation in shared meals and governance than those with smaller or no common facilities.

The arrangement matters. Successful cohousing places the common house where residents pass it daily — at the entrance, along the main path, or at the center of a courtyard. Parking is always at the periphery. At Quayside Village in North Vancouver, completed in 1998, nineteen units face a central courtyard with the common house anchoring one end; cars are relegated to an underground garage. The physical layout produces the social outcome: when the path from your door to your car passes the common house, you encounter neighbors; when the path bypasses it, you don't.

Alexander's House Cluster (37) proposed groupings of eight to twelve houses sharing a common land and common outdoor spaces, but stopped short of shared indoor facilities. Cohousing extends this logic: the cluster shares not only outdoor space but also a common house — a building that belongs to everyone and therefore belongs to the community itself.

**Therefore: cluster fifteen to thirty-five private dwellings around a shared common house of at least 8 square meters per household, containing at minimum a commercial kitchen, a dining hall seating all residents, one guest bedroom, and a workshop or hobby room. Arrange the dwellings so that the daily path from every front door to parking passes within 15 meters of the common house entrance. Give each dwelling its own front door, its own private outdoor space, and complete living facilities — kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms — so that the common house supplements rather than replaces private life. The cluster passes the test if a resident walking from their front door to their car must pass the common house, and if the dining hall can seat every adult resident at a single meal.**
