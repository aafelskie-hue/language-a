# 219. The Cooperative Governance [★]

**…beyond Community Land Trust (50) and Alexander's Community of 7000 (12)…**

**When housing is owned by distant landlords or faceless corporations, residents become tenants in their own lives — unable to fix what needs fixing, unable to improve what could be beautiful, unable to plan beyond the next lease renewal. Yet when each household acts alone, the neighborhood has no collective voice, no shared resources, no ability to negotiate with the forces that shape it. The tension is between individual autonomy and collective power: people need both the freedom to make their own home and the strength that comes only from acting together.**

The housing cooperative is not a new invention. The Rochdale Pioneers established cooperative principles in England in 1844, and cooperative housing followed within decades. What distinguishes cooperatives from other forms of collective ownership is democratic control: one member, one vote, regardless of the size of unit or the amount of equity. In a cooperative, you do not buy an apartment — you buy a share in an organization that owns the building and grants you the right to occupy a unit. You are simultaneously owner and tenant, landlord and resident.

The evidence from long-established cooperatives suggests they create stability without stagnation. A 2006 study by the National Association of Housing Cooperatives found that U.S. housing cooperatives had an average tenure of 16 years per household, compared to 5-7 years for rental housing. In Sweden, where cooperative housing (bostadsrätt) accounts for roughly 22% of all housing stock, the system has operated since 1923 and produces neighborhoods where residents invest in maintenance and improvement because they capture the benefits. The Stockholms Kooperativa Bostadsförening, founded in 1916, still operates today, its buildings well-maintained after a century of resident governance.

The mechanics matter. Cooperatives typically require monthly carrying charges (covering mortgage, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and reserves) rather than rent. Decisions about major repairs, capital improvements, and house rules flow through an elected board and, for significant matters, a vote of all members. This creates friction — decisions take longer, meetings can be contentious — but the friction is productive. It forces neighbors to negotiate, to persuade, to find common ground. Alexander understood this in Community of 7000 (12), where he argued that a community needs to be small enough for people to know each other and large enough to sustain shared institutions. A housing cooperative is precisely such an institution: small enough for face-to-face governance, large enough to employ professional management when needed.

In Edmonton, the Sundance Housing Cooperative (founded 1981) and the Greater Edmonton Foundation's cooperative housing portfolio demonstrate that this model functions in a Canadian legal and climatic context. Alberta's Cooperatives Act provides the legal structure; the cooperative provides the social one. The key spatial requirement is a place to meet. A cooperative without a common room is a cooperative that meets in living rooms or rents church basements — possible, but harder to sustain over decades.

**Therefore: when a group of households seeks collective ownership — whether in a new building, a converted apartment block, or a cluster of townhouses — incorporate as a housing cooperative under provincial law. Establish membership shares, monthly carrying charges, and a governance structure with an elected board and annual general meetings. Provide a common room sized for the full membership to gather (at minimum, two square meters per unit, with a lower bound of 30 square meters). Hold monthly board meetings and at least one annual meeting where every member votes on the budget, major expenditures, and house rules. Test the health of the cooperative by this measure: at least 60% of member households should participate in the annual meeting, in person or by proxy.**
