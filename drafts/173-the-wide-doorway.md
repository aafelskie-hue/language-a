# 173. The Wide Doorway [★]

**…beyond Universal Design Standard (171), The Lifetime Home (15), and Connected Rooms (39)…**

**When doorways are sized for a single able-bodied person walking through empty-handed, they become traps and barriers for everyone else: the wheelchair that cannot pass, the walker that catches on the frame, the parent carrying a sleeping child, the friends moving a couch, the caregiver pushing a hospital bed. Yet wider doors cost more, take more wall space, and can feel out of proportion in smaller rooms — so builders default to the minimum, creating homes that work well for twenty years and then fail catastrophically when bodies change.**

The conflict between standard construction and actual human movement is measured in inches. A standard interior door in North American construction is 30 inches wide, sometimes 32 inches. After accounting for the door stop and the thickness of the door in the swing, the clear opening — the space a body or object can actually pass through — shrinks to 27 or 29 inches. A standard manual wheelchair is 24 to 27 inches wide at the wheels; an electric wheelchair or scooter is often 24 to 28 inches. The math is brutal: the wheelchair fits, barely, if the user has perfect alignment, strong arms, and nothing protruding from the chair. Add an armrest, a bag, or a slight angle of approach, and the doorway becomes impassable.

The Americans with Disabilities Act requires 32 inches of clear width for doorways in public accommodations — a dimension achieved by a 36-inch door. The Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines require the same for covered multifamily housing. But single-family homes, where most people age, where most care happens, where most falls occur, remain exempt from federal accessibility requirements. The result is a housing stock where the majority of interior doorways cannot admit a wheelchair. When disability arrives — through age, accident, or illness — the family faces a choice: tear out door frames and rebuild, or leave home.

The cost difference is trivial at the time of construction. A 36-inch prehung door costs ten to thirty dollars more than a 30-inch door of the same style. The rough opening requires an additional six inches of header, a few more minutes of framing labor. But a retrofit — removing trim, cutting studs, reframing, rehanging, refinishing — runs five hundred to two thousand dollars per doorway, plus the disruption, plus the dust, plus the delay that means the person recovering from hip surgery cannot come home yet.

Alexander, in A Pattern Language, wrote of the importance of room-to-room connections but did not specify dimensions. The gap he left — how wide, exactly, should these openings be — is filled by the wheelchair. The chair is not a medical device intruding on domestic space; it is a test of whether the space is domestic at all. A home that cannot admit a wheelchair is a home that will eventually expel someone who lives there.

**Therefore: make every doorway in the dwelling at least 36 inches wide, providing a clear opening of at least 32 inches after door thickness and hardware are accounted for. This applies to every door: entry doors, bedroom doors, bathroom doors, closet doors. Use lever handles, not knobs. Hang doors to swing out of small rooms where possible, or use pocket doors or barn doors where swing clearance is tight. The test: a person in a standard wheelchair (26 inches wide) should be able to pass through every doorway in the home without touching the frame, without backing up to realign, and without assistance.**

**…this pattern is the smallest-scale element in its chain, implementing the dimensions required by Universal Design Standard (171), The Zero-Step Entry (172), The Lifetime Home (15), The Care Suite (80), and The Aging-in-Place Checklist (248)…**
