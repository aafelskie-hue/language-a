# 134. The Preserving Kitchen [☆]

**…beyond The Four-Season Greenhouse (24), The Edible Landscape (25), The Food Forest (132), The Root Cellar (133), and The Community Kitchen (94)…**

**When a household grows food in abundance — from the greenhouse, the edible landscape, or connection to local farms — the harvest arrives all at once. A week of ripe tomatoes, a bushel of cucumbers, a crate of apples. The ordinary kitchen, designed for daily cooking in small batches, cannot handle this abundance. Counter space disappears. The single sink backs up. The stove holds four pots when you need eight. And so the harvest rots, or goes to chickens, or never gets grown at all because last year's waste still stings. The short northern growing season demands preservation; the modern kitchen makes preservation nearly impossible.**

Alexander's pattern 139, *Farmhouse Kitchen*, calls for a country kitchen large enough to accommodate the whole work of the household — not just cooking, but canning, baking, sewing, children's homework. He understood that the isolated, compact kitchen of apartment planning serves neither family life nor productive work. But his pattern does not address the specific infrastructure that preservation requires: the heat load of water-bath canning, the ventilation for fermentation, the surfaces that can be sterilized, the storage for jars by the hundred.

In Edmonton, the growing season runs roughly 120 frost-free days — May to September. A productive household with even modest food-growing ambitions will face, in August, the simultaneous ripening of tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, beets, and stone fruit. Traditional northern cultures understood this: the Nordic *matbod* (food storage room), the Japanese *doma* (earthen-floored work kitchen), and the Ukrainian summer kitchen all separated heavy food processing from daily cooking. The separation served ventilation (steam and fermentation odors), sanitation (raw produce and soil kept from cooked food), and scale (large batches require large surfaces).

Modern canning requires specific conditions. Water-bath canning for high-acid foods demands a pot large enough to cover quart jars with two inches of boiling water — at least a 21-liter pot — running for 30 to 45 minutes per batch. A household preserving 50 kilograms of tomatoes processes perhaps ten batches. The heat and steam load would overwhelm a 10-square-meter residential kitchen, driving temperatures above 35°C and coating surfaces with condensation. Commercial kitchens solve this with powerful exhaust hoods rated at 500 CFM or more; residential range hoods typically move 150-300 CFM. The preserving kitchen needs either commercial-grade ventilation or an exterior location where summer heat and steam can escape.

The critical dimensions are these: counter space must accommodate washing, cutting, blanching, packing, and cooling simultaneously — at minimum, six linear meters of work surface. A double sink, or a single deep sink supplemented by a utility tub, allows continuous washing without bottlenecking. Floor drains permit the inevitable spills of boiling water and brine. Shelving for empty jars waiting to be filled and filled jars cooling before storage requires at least four square meters of wall area. And because preservation is seasonal — intense in August and September, idle from November through April — the space must either serve other purposes or cost little to maintain.

**Therefore: in any household that grows, forages, or buys food in seasonal abundance, provide a preserving kitchen — a dedicated or convertible workspace of at least 8 square meters with 6 linear meters of waterproof counter, a deep double sink, a high-output burner or dedicated canning element, and mechanical ventilation rated at 400 CFM or more. Locate it adjacent to the main kitchen or in a connected outbuilding — a summer kitchen, attached garage, or basement with exterior access. Provide shelving for at least 200 one-liter jars. Include floor drainage. The space is working when a household can process a bushel of tomatoes — roughly 25 kilograms — into canned sauce in a single afternoon without overheating the main dwelling, and when the filled jars can rest undisturbed for 24 hours before moving to the root cellar.**
