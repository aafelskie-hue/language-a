# 157. The Thermal Imaging Survey [☆]

**…beyond Building Envelope as Climate System (22)…**

**When insulation is hidden inside walls and air leaks through invisible cracks, the building performs far worse than its specifications promise — yet no one can see where the failures are. Builders blame occupant behavior; occupants blame the builder; and the house goes on bleeding heat through gaps that could be found and fixed in an afternoon, if only someone would look with the right instrument.**

An infrared camera translates temperature differences into visible color gradients. Point it at a wall during cold weather, and every thermal defect announces itself: the cold blue line where a stud bridges the insulation, the purple bloom where air leaks through an unsealed electrical box, the dark rectangle where the installer missed a cavity entirely. What was invisible becomes obvious. What was contested becomes documented. What was unfixable becomes a ten-minute repair with a can of foam.

The physics demand a temperature differential. In Edmonton, this is abundant — when the outdoor temperature drops to -20°C and the indoor temperature holds at 21°C, a 41-degree difference drives heat outward through every weakness. The greater the differential, the more clearly defects appear. This is why thermal imaging in cold climates is more diagnostic than in temperate regions: the signal is stronger, the failures more visible. A minimum 10°C differential is typically required for useful results; Edmonton provides three to four times that on a typical January day.

But timing matters as much as temperature. Direct sunlight on exterior walls stores heat in the cladding and masks the thermal signature of defects beneath. Wind increases convective heat loss and can make the entire envelope appear uniformly cold. The clearest images come on overcast winter mornings, before sunrise, when the building has equilibrated overnight and the sky provides a uniform cold background. Interior scans work differently: they reveal cold spots where outdoor air infiltrates or insulation fails, but they miss problems in walls that are performing adequately on their interior surface while failing outboard.

The most powerful diagnostic combines infrared imaging with a blower door. When the building is depressurized to 50 Pascals, air rushes inward through every crack and gap, carrying cold outdoor air deep into the assembly. These infiltration paths light up on the infrared camera — not as static cold spots, but as active streams, branching and spreading as you watch. A skilled operator can trace leakage from its entry point at the sill plate, up through the wall cavity, and out at the ceiling junction. This combined test — specified in standards like ASTM E1186 for air leakage location — transforms the blower door from a pass-fail measurement into a diagnostic map.

Alexander's pattern language had no equivalent to this. In 1977, infrared cameras cost tens of thousands of dollars and required cryogenic cooling. Today, a camera adequate for building diagnostics costs under $500 and connects to a smartphone. The technology has democratized thermal vision — and with it, the ability to verify that the super-insulated envelope (129), the air sealing strategy (130), and the thermal bridge elimination (128) have been executed as designed, not just specified on paper.

**Therefore: conduct a thermal imaging survey during the first heating season of any new building, and before mechanical upgrades in any retrofit. Schedule the scan for an overcast morning when the outdoor temperature is at least 10°C below indoor setpoint — in Edmonton, any winter morning will do. Combine exterior and interior scans: exterior to reveal insulation voids and thermal bridges; interior, under blower door depressurization at 50 Pa, to trace air leakage paths. Document every anomaly with a photograph in both infrared and visible spectrum. Repair defects before final commissioning. The test passes when the envelope appears as a uniform thermal field — no cold lines tracing studs, no bright plumes at penetrations, no missing rectangles where insulation should be.**
