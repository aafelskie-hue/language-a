To properly research this pattern, I would need web search access to find verifiable information about community orchard programs, particularly in cold-climate cities. From general knowledge, programs like Philadelphia's Neighborhood Orchards and Seattle's P-Patch gardens exist, but I cannot verify current statistics, outcomes, or specific details without search capability. Please re-run this research task with web search permissions enabled."
