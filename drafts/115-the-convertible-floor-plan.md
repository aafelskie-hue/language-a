# 115. The Convertible Floor Plan [★]

**…beyond The Pocket Neighborhood (111), The Multigenerational Suite (14), and Connected Rooms (39)…**

**When walls are load-bearing and fixed, the household faces an impossible choice: live in rooms that no longer fit their lives — the nursery that should become a study, the spare bedroom that could be a workshop, the two small rooms that want to be one large one — or undertake renovations that cost tens of thousands of dollars, produce months of disruption, and generate tonnes of construction waste. The dwelling that was perfect for the young couple is wrong for the family with children, wrong again for the teenagers who need separation, and wrong a third time for the aging parents who need a caregiver's room. Each transition demands either adaptation of the household to the building or demolition of the building to fit the household.**

The Dutch architect N.J. Habraken, in his 1961 book *Supports: An Alternative to Mass Housing*, argued that the failure of postwar housing was not aesthetic but structural: by fixing both the support (the building's permanent frame) and the infill (the partitions, kitchens, bathrooms that define rooms), architects froze dwellings at a single moment in time. Habraken proposed separating these layers — a permanent support designed for a century, an infill designed for a decade. The household would own its infill and reconfigure it as life changed.

This idea was tested at scale in Japan beginning in the 1980s under the name "Skeleton-Infill" (SI) housing. The Osaka Gas experimental building NEXT21, completed in 1993, housed eighteen units within a concrete frame where every interior partition, kitchen, and bathroom was demountable. Over thirty years, units have been reconfigured multiple times — walls moved, kitchens relocated, two units merged, one unit split — without touching the structure. The Tokyo Metropolitan Housing Supply Corporation adopted SI principles for public housing in the 2000s; residents reported higher satisfaction and longer tenures than in conventional stock, and the corporation documented lower lifecycle costs because interior renovations required no structural permits and no demolition waste.

Alexander anticipated this in pattern 205, *Structure Follows Social Spaces*, which argued that structure should be placed at the boundaries of social spaces so that future changes to room layout would not require structural alteration. But Alexander did not specify how the non-structural infill should be built to make change practical rather than merely possible. That gap is filled here: the convertible floor plan requires not only that structure be moved to the perimeter but that infill be designed as a demountable system — partitions that unbolt, services that run in accessible zones, finishes that relocate without patching.

The economic case is straightforward. A conventional wall relocation in Edmonton — removing a 3-metre partition, reframing an opening, patching drywall, repainting — costs $3,000 to $8,000 and takes two to four weeks when scheduled through a contractor. A demountable partition system adds 10–15% to initial construction cost but reduces reconfiguration to a one-day task costing under $500 in labour. Over a fifty-year building life with three major household transitions, the demountable approach saves $10,000–$20,000 per unit and eliminates six to twelve weeks of construction disruption.

**Therefore: design every dwelling so that interior partitions are non-load-bearing and demountable, and all electrical, data, and plumbing services run through accessible zones — raised floors, ceiling plenums, or perimeter raceways — rather than through partition cavities. Place structural columns and load-bearing walls only at the perimeter and at fixed service cores (bathrooms, stairs, mechanical shafts). Use a planning grid — 600mm or 900mm module — that aligns door widths, outlet spacing, and partition positions. The test: two people with a cordless drill and a furniture dolly should be able to remove a partition, relocate it to a new grid position, and restore electrical service within eight hours, with no patching, no mudding, no repainting, and no permit.**
