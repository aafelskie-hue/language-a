# 125. The Wind Scoop [★]

**…beyond Cross Ventilation (122), The Thermal Chimney (123), The Night Flush (124), and The Sheltering Roof (37)…**

**When a building is designed for cross ventilation but the wind arrives from above the roofline, or swirls unpredictably around neighboring structures, the carefully placed windows catch nothing — the room has openings on two walls but the air inside remains still. You can add fans, but fans cost energy, make noise, and fail when the power fails. You can open more windows, but more glass means more heat gain, more security risk, more noise from the street. The tension: how do you catch a breeze that passes over the building instead of through it, without adding mechanical systems, without compromising the envelope, and without building a tower that dominates the roof?**

For millennia, builders in hot climates solved this problem with wind catchers — towers that rise above the roofline to intercept moving air and direct it downward into the building. In Yazd, Iran, hundreds of traditional *badgirs* still stand, some predating the Islamic period, their tall rectangular shafts dividing the wind into channels that serve different rooms below. UNESCO's World Heritage documentation for Yazd acknowledges these structures as sophisticated environmental technology. Studies by M.N. Bahadori, published in *Scientific American* in 1978, documented how badgirs can reduce indoor temperatures by 8–12°C compared to outdoor conditions in hot-arid climates — not through mechanical refrigeration but through the simple physics of moving air across skin and thermal mass.

Modern architects have adapted this ancient form. At the Queen's Building of De Montfort University in Leicester, UK (Short Ford Associates, 1993), massive ventilation stacks rise from the roof, their openings oriented to catch prevailing winds and draw air upward through the building by combining wind pressure with stack effect. At the BedZED development in south London (2002), colorful rotating wind cowls top each residential unit, capturing wind from any direction and channeling it through heat recovery ventilators. These cowls have become the project's visual signature — proof that environmental technology can be beautiful rather than hidden. Hughes, Calautit, and Ghani's 2012 review in *Applied Energy* documented that commercial wind tower systems can achieve 10–30 air changes per hour depending on wind conditions, rivaling or exceeding mechanical ventilation without consuming electricity.

The wind scoop differs from a simple opening in two ways: it rises above the boundary layer of turbulent, slow-moving air that hugs the roof surface, and it creates positive pressure on the windward side that actively pushes air into the building rather than waiting for negative pressure to pull it through. Combined with a thermal chimney on the leeward side, a wind scoop creates a complete passive ventilation circuit — wind pushes air in, stack effect pulls it out, and the building breathes without a single watt of electricity.

In Edmonton, where summer temperatures now regularly exceed 30°C but prevailing northwest winds remain reliable, a wind scoop offers a way to reduce air conditioning loads during the short intense summer — and to maintain airflow during power outages when mechanical cooling fails precisely when it is needed most.

**Therefore: where a building requires natural ventilation and prevailing summer winds are reliable, install a wind scoop — a projecting element on the roof or upper wall, oriented to face the dominant summer wind direction, that captures moving air above the roofline and channels it into the building's ventilation path. Size the scoop opening to at least 0.15 square meters per 25 square meters of floor area served. Raise the intake at least 1.5 meters above the surrounding roof surface to clear the turbulent boundary layer. Connect the scoop to the building's cross-ventilation path (122), with an unobstructed duct or shaft leading to low-level outlets in occupied rooms. Where wind direction varies, use a rotating cowl or multi-directional fixed louvers. The test: on a day with 3 m/s wind measured at 10 meters above grade, hold a tissue at a low outlet in the room served — it should deflect outward with visible movement, confirming positive airflow from scoop to outlet.**

**…this pattern connects to The Solar Roof (127) for integration with the roof form, The Living Roof (131) where the scoop penetrates a vegetated surface, and The Heat Pump System (194) which the scoop may reduce or eliminate in shoulder seasons…**
