  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - search and fetch permissions not granted. The 'outdoor room' concept is well-established in architecture (Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language includes related patterns like 'Outdoor Room' #163, 'Six-Foot Balcony' #167, and 'Gallery Surround' #166), but I cannot verify current statistics, programs, or recent studies without web access. Known relevant areas to search: National Association of Home Builders outdoor living surveys, biophilic design research from Terrapin Bright Green, American Society of Landscape Architects resources, and case studies from firms like IDEO and landscape architecture journals. Recommend re-running this research with web search permissions enabled."
