# 110. The Charging Station [☆]

**…beyond The Charging Threshold (11), The Screen-Free Hearth (8), The Visible Utility (68), and The Utility Core (156)…**

**When every device in the household charges wherever there happens to be an outlet — phone on the kitchen counter, tablet on the nightstand, laptop trailing its cord across the couch, headphones dangling from a power strip behind the door — the dwelling accumulates a permanent tangle of cables, adapters, and half-charged devices. You cannot set down a cup of coffee without moving a charging phone. You cannot find the right cable because six of them are coiled together behind the bookshelf. The visual clutter whispers constantly: this house is not quite in order. Yet the devices must charge somewhere, and convenience pulls them toward wherever you happen to set them down.**

The average North American household now contains somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five connected devices requiring regular charging — phones, tablets, laptops, watches, earbuds, e-readers, game controllers, portable speakers, and the expanding category of rechargeable tools. Each device arrives with its own cable and adapter. Without a designated location, these accumulate in junk drawers, tangle behind furniture, and migrate across every horizontal surface in the house.

The problem is architectural, not organizational. No amount of cable ties or charging baskets will solve what is fundamentally a failure to provide a place. Alexander understood this principle: in his Pattern 197 (Thick Walls), he argued that walls should be deep enough to accommodate the activities that cluster at edges — sitting, storage, display. The modern equivalent is that walls must now accommodate power. A shallow wall with a single duplex outlet every twelve feet — the minimum code requirement — cannot support the electrical reality of contemporary life.

The Visible Utility (68) establishes that infrastructure should be traceable and accessible. The Utility Core (156) consolidates major systems for maintenance. The Charging Station applies the same logic at the scale of daily electronics: consolidate the charging function into a single, purpose-built location so that cables, adapters, and devices have a home. When each device has a designated slot, the rest of the dwelling can remain free of cables — including The Screen-Free Hearth (8), which depends on keeping technology out of social space. The Charging Threshold (11) handles the vehicle and the arrival sequence; this pattern handles everything smaller, the pocket-sized devices that follow you through the day.

The location matters. It should be near but not in the main living spaces — a hallway nook, the edge of a mudroom, a deep windowsill near the entrance, or a dedicated alcove off the kitchen. The station should be visible enough that you remember to use it, but contained enough that it doesn't dominate. Depth is essential: a shelf or counter at least ten inches deep, with outlets at the back and cable channels or grommets to keep cords organized. The best versions include a drawer or cabinet below for storing backup cables, adapters, and devices not in daily use.

**Therefore: build a dedicated charging station into the dwelling — a shelf, niche, or shallow cabinet at least 30 inches wide and 10 inches deep, equipped with a minimum of six USB outlets and two standard receptacles, located within 15 feet of the main entrance but outside the primary living and sleeping rooms. Provide cable management — grommets, channels, or a raised shelf with a gap behind — so that cords route neatly from outlet to device. The test: every portable electronic device in the household should have a designated charging slot at this station, and no other room should require a charging cable left permanently plugged in.**

**…this pattern is the smallest scale in its chain; it implements The Charging Threshold (11), The Screen-Free Hearth (8), The Visible Utility (68), and The Utility Core (156)…**
