The stacked townhouse typology (also known as 'maisonettes' in UK/European contexts) is a recognized housing form, but I cannot provide verified citations without search access. Key concepts that WOULD need verification: CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation) research on ground-related housing preferences; UK housing association maisonette developments; Vancouver's 'missing middle' housing policies; academic research on housing satisfaction for families in various dwelling types. Please re-run this query with web search permissions enabled."
