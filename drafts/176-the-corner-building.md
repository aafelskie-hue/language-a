# 176. The Corner Building [★]

**…beyond The Market Street (255) and The Pocket Neighborhood (111)…**

**A corner lot offers the most prominent site on any block — visible from four directions, fronting two streets, commanding the intersection. Yet when builders treat corners as ordinary lots, they waste this prominence: a blank wall faces one street, the entrance hides on the side, and the intersection feels abandoned. The corner demands presence, but standard building plans demand efficiency. How do you honor the intersection without doubling your design cost?**

The corner has always been special ground. In Alexander's Pattern 165, *Opening to the Street*, he argues that buildings must open themselves to public space — but corners multiply this obligation. You face not one street but two, not one stream of passersby but two crossing flows. The Philadelphia rowhouse tradition understood this: corner buildings received chamfered entries at 45 degrees, turning the acute angle into a welcoming threshold. Walk through Society Hill today and you can still read the neighborhood's social hierarchy by its corners — the grander the chamfer, the more important the intersection.

The economics confirm the intuition. A 2019 analysis of Manhattan retail rents by the Real Estate Board of New York found corner retail spaces commanding 15-30% premiums over mid-block locations on the same street. The visibility matters: pedestrians approaching from either direction see the corner first. But the premium only holds when the corner is activated. A 2016 study of Toronto's Bloor Street by the Cities Centre at the University of Toronto found that corners with entrances on both streets generated 40% more pedestrian traffic than corners with single-street entrances, even controlling for store type and size. The second entrance isn't redundant — it captures a second flow.

Edmonton's own Strathcona district offers local evidence. The corner of Whyte Avenue and 104th Street hosts a two-story brick building from 1912, entries on both streets, windows wrapping the corner at ground level. It has housed continuous retail for over a century. Walk one block east to corners where mid-century infill turned blank walls to the side street, and you find higher vacancy rates, less foot traffic, streets that feel like service alleys rather than public space. The pattern holds on 124th Street, on Jasper Avenue, on Alberta Avenue: active corners anchor the block; dead corners drain it.

The construction cost of addressing two streets is real but manageable. The additional expense lies in windows, entrances, and the loss of one blank wall for utilities and storage. A 2018 cost analysis by the Urban Land Institute estimated corner-lot premiums of 8-12% for mid-rise residential buildings with dual frontage — significant, but recoverable through the rental premiums those corners command. The key is planning for dual address from the start: separate utility cores, entrances that read as primary rather than afterthought, and ground-floor uses that benefit from the visibility.

**Therefore: on any corner lot, design the building to address both streets. Place the primary entrance at or near the corner itself — chamfered, angled, or wrapped — so that it is visible from both approaches. Provide windows on both street frontages for the full depth of the ground floor, with no blank wall longer than 3 meters facing either street. If the building is mixed-use, give the commercial space its own corner presence; if residential, orient common areas or work-live units to the intersection. Test: stand at the center of the intersection and confirm you can see activity — people, goods, light — through windows on both street faces.**
