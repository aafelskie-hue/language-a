This pattern likely has strong evidence available (battery storage is a well-documented field with programs like California's SGIP, federal ITC credits, and extensive NREL/EIA research), but I cannot confirm specific citations without search access. Please re-run with WebSearch/WebFetch permissions enabled, or manually verify evidence from sources like: US DOE, EIA, NREL, California Energy Commission, and academic databases."
