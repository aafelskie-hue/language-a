# 117. The Smoke-Sealed Room [☆]

**…beyond THE RESILIENCE NETWORK (116), AIR QUALITY BY DESIGN (31), HEAT REFUGE ROOM (16), and DEFENSIBLE SPACE (WILDFIRE) (18)…**

**When wildfire smoke blankets a region for days or weeks, outdoor air becomes hazardous — but most homes allow 50-60% of outdoor particulates to infiltrate indoors. The old and the young, those with respiratory conditions, cannot leave. They cannot open windows. They breathe PM2.5 at levels the EPA classifies as "unhealthy" or "very unhealthy" — 35 to 150+ micrograms per cubic meter — while trying to sleep, eat, work, and care for children. The choice becomes: suffer in contaminated air throughout the entire dwelling, or have nowhere to go at all.**

During British Columbia's 2018 wildfire season, Victoria recorded 33 consecutive days with smoke advisories. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations in typical homes reached 60% of outdoor levels — enough to cause eye irritation, coughing, and exacerbation of asthma and heart conditions. Barn et al. (2019), measuring indoor air quality in 60 homes during wildfire smoke events, found that without intervention, indoor PM2.5 averaged 52 µg/m³ when outdoor levels reached 88 µg/m³. But homes using portable HEPA filters in a single sealed room reduced concentrations to 12 µg/m³ — below the WHO guideline of 15 µg/m³. The combination of reduced infiltration and continuous filtration achieved a 77% reduction in particulate exposure.

California's 2020 Creek Fire displaced 30,000 people and blanketed Fresno in smoke for weeks. Public health officials opened clean air shelters in libraries and community centers, but most residents sheltered at home. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District began recommending "clean air rooms" — a single bedroom sealed and filtered to provide refuge. The physics are straightforward: a typical bedroom exchanges air at 0.5-1.0 ACH. Weather-stripping doors, sealing window gaps, and blocking vents reduces this to 0.1-0.2 ACH. A portable HEPA filter sized for the room volume, running continuously, removes 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns and larger. Together, these measures maintain indoor PM2.5 below 12 µg/m³ even when outdoor air exceeds 100 µg/m³.

This extends Alexander's thinking on refuge within the dwelling. Just as HEAT REFUGE ROOM (16) provides a place to survive when mechanical cooling fails, the smoke-sealed room provides a place to breathe when outdoor air becomes poison. The two functions can share the same space — a north-facing bedroom with high thermal mass, tight construction, and dedicated filtration serves both needs. What matters is intentional design during construction, not emergency retrofit with tape and towels: a room built tighter than the rest of the house, with a closable door, a dedicated filtration system, and enough space to shelter a household for days or weeks.

**Therefore: in every dwelling in a region prone to wildfire smoke, designate one room — ideally a bedroom large enough to shelter the household — as a clean air refuge. Seal this room to a higher standard than the rest of the house: gaskets on the door, sealed electrical outlets, caulked window frames, no return air vents connecting to central HVAC. Install a dedicated HEPA filtration system sized to deliver at least 5 air changes per hour (for a 12'×14'×8' bedroom, roughly 150 CFM). Test the room with a blower door after construction, targeting infiltration below 0.15 ACH50. Verify performance with a portable PM2.5 monitor: with outdoor levels above 100 µg/m³, indoor concentration must stay below 12 µg/m³.**
