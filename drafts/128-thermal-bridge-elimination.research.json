  "notes": "Unable to conduct web searches to verify evidence. Thermal bridging is a well-documented phenomenon in building science with substantial technical literature, but I cannot provide properly sourced citations without web access. Known relevant sources include: Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) guidance on thermal bridges, Passive House Institute requirements for thermal-bridge-free construction (Ψ ≤ 0.01 W/mK), BC Energy Step Code thermal bridging requirements, and numerous academic studies on linear thermal transmittance. Request web search permissions to gather verified evidence."
