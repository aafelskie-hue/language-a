# 148. The Heated Sidewalk [☆]

**…beyond The Winter City Street (58) and The Local Street (43)…**

**When snow and ice accumulate on sidewalks, two forces collide: the cost and complexity of snow-melting infrastructure against the daily reality that un-cleared walks become impassable barriers — trapping the elderly indoors, forcing wheelchair users into traffic, and turning every pedestrian into a liability calculation. Manual clearing cannot win this battle. A sidewalk shoveled at seven in the morning is glazed with ice by noon. Salt corrodes wheelchairs, poisons trees, and fails below -15°C. The ice does not negotiate.**

In cold cities, falls on ice are not minor inconveniences — they are a leading cause of winter emergency room visits. Edmonton's climate delivers roughly 120 days per year with snow on the ground and daily freeze-thaw cycles that turn cleared sidewalks into skating rinks within hours. For anyone using a walker, cane, or wheelchair, an icy sidewalk is not difficult — it is impossible. The result: winter becomes a season of isolation for those who most need to reach clinics, groceries, and neighbours.

Heated sidewalk systems exist in two basic forms: electric resistance cables embedded in concrete, and hydronic systems circulating warm fluid through tubing. Hydronic systems become economical when waste heat is available — from power plants, district heating networks, or geothermal sources. Holland, Michigan has operated a downtown snowmelt system since the 1980s, using waste heat from a municipal power plant to keep approximately five blocks of sidewalks and streets clear. Reykjavik, Iceland heats downtown pedestrian areas with geothermal hot water that would otherwise be discharged. These are not experiments — they are mature infrastructure with decades of operational history. The energy cost is substantial, but it is offset against the hidden costs of the alternative: emergency medical visits, slip-and-fall liability, lost commerce when downtown becomes unwalkable, and the slow atrophy of street life when walking is punishing five months of the year.

The pattern applies only where pedestrian traffic justifies the investment: transit stops, commercial main streets, building entrances, and the critical paths that connect seniors' residences to essential services. A heated sidewalk on a quiet residential crescent is a poor use of resources. A heated sidewalk at a light-rail platform or outside a hospital entrance is infrastructure that pays for itself in prevented falls and sustained mobility.

**Therefore: at transit stops, commercial main streets, and building entrances in high-traffic pedestrian zones, install hydronic snow-melting systems beneath the walking surface. Size the system to maintain surface temperatures above 0°C during snowfall events. Where waste heat sources exist within 500 metres — district heating mains, co-generation plants, large buildings with excess heat rejection — connect to them. Where no waste heat is available, concentrate heated surfaces at the three critical points: transit platforms, building entrance zones extending three metres from the door, and ramps or grade changes where ice is most dangerous. The test: on the coldest day of January, a person in a wheelchair should be able to travel the full length of the commercial street without encountering ice.**
