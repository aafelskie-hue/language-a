  "notes": "UNABLE TO VERIFY: Web search and fetch tools were not available. I have general knowledge about warehouse conversions (e.g., Ponce City Market in Atlanta, Industry City in Brooklyn, historic loft districts in SoHo and DUMBO), but I cannot provide properly sourced citations with URLs, specific statistics with years, or confirm current policy details. The pattern topic itself is well-established in urban planning practice, but this research output would require web access to meet the verification standard. Please grant WebSearch or WebFetch permissions and re-run."
