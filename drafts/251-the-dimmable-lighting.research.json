  "notes": "Unable to gather evidence - web search and fetch tools are not available. This research task requires web access to find verifiable sources with URLs. The pattern concept (dimmable lighting for energy savings, task matching, and circadian alignment) is well-established in lighting design literature, but I cannot provide properly cited evidence without search capabilities. Key sources to investigate when tools are available: U.S. DOE Solid-State Lighting program, IEA lighting reports, ASHRAE/IESNA standards, California Title 24 lighting requirements, and peer-reviewed studies in journals like Lighting Research & Technology and Building and Environment."
