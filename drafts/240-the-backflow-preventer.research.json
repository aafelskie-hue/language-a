  "notes": "IMPORTANT: Web search was not available for this research. The pattern itself is well-established in plumbing practice and building codes - backflow prevention is a mature, widely-mandated technology. However, I cannot provide verified statistics, specific academic citations, or documented incident data without search access. The evidence strength is marked 'thin' not because the practice lacks support, but because I cannot provide properly sourced citations. Recommend re-running this research with web search enabled to gather specific EPA reports, AWWA studies, and documented contamination incidents that would demonstrate strong evidence."
