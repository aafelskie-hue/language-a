  "notes": "WITHOUT WEB SEARCH ACCESS, I cannot verify current URLs or confirm specific statistics. The examples cited are well-documented in architectural literature, but specific performance metrics require verification. Traditional wind catchers (badgirs) are extensively documented; modern applications have more variable evidence quality. The Bahadori 1978 study is a legitimate foundational reference. Recommend web search verification for: (1) specific energy savings percentages, (2) current BREEAM credit values, (3) Masdar performance data, (4) any post-2024 studies. Evidence is moderate because the technology is well-established historically but modern performance data is more scattered."
