# 199. The Pollinator Pathway [★]

**…beyond Green Corridors (44) and Alexander's Green Streets (51)…**

**When landscapes are fragmented into isolated patches of lawn, pavement, and ornamental plantings, pollinators cannot find the continuous sequence of blooms they need to survive. A single garden, however beautiful, is a one-night hotel with no meals. Without connected habitat, bees exhaust themselves searching for the next flower; without pollinators, the fruit trees and vegetable gardens of The Edible Landscape (25) set empty blossoms and yield nothing.**

The original Pollinator Pathway in Seattle demonstrated what connection looks like. In 2007, artist Sarah Bergmann organized property owners along a one-mile stretch of Columbia Street to plant pollinator-friendly gardens in their yards, creating a continuous corridor from Seattle University to Nora's Woods. The plantings were modest — native wildflowers, herbs, flowering shrubs — but the continuity was the innovation. A bee leaving one garden could see the next. The pathway has since been replicated in dozens of cities, each adapting the species palette to local conditions.

The science supports the spatial logic. Pollinators forage within limited ranges — most native bees travel fewer than 500 meters from their nesting sites; even honeybees rarely exceed 3 kilometers when adequate forage is nearby. Fragmented habitat forces longer flights, burning energy reserves that should go to reproduction. A 2016 study by Hemberger and Gratton in *Ecological Applications* found that wild bee abundance declined sharply when the nearest floral patch was more than 750 meters away. The threshold is spatial: it's not enough to have flowers somewhere in the neighborhood; they must be reachable without crossing a desert of lawn.

In the United Kingdom, Buglife's B-Lines initiative has mapped over 3,000 kilometers of proposed "insect pathways" connecting fragmented wildlife sites. The premise is infrastructural — pollinator habitat treated like roads or utilities, something that must connect, not merely exist. Oslo has experimented with a "bee highway" using rooftop gardens and street plantings to thread habitat through dense urban fabric. These projects recognize that corridors serve pollinators just as Green Corridors (44) serve stormwater and pedestrians. The same five-meter planted strip that infiltrates runoff and shades a walking path can carry a succession of blooms from April through October.

Alexander's Green Streets (51) called for grass and trees along residential roads. The Pollinator Pathway adds a finer grain: not just green, but *flowering* — a continuous sequence of nectar and pollen sources timed to overlap across the growing season. Early willows and crocuses for queens emerging in spring. Clovers and wildflowers through summer. Asters and goldenrod into fall. The corridor becomes a table set with food from snowmelt to frost.

**Therefore: along every Green Corridor (44), plant a continuous pollinator pathway — a band of flowering plants at least two meters wide, with species selected to provide overlapping bloom from early spring through late fall. Choose at least three species blooming in each season: spring, early summer, high summer, and fall. Use native plants where possible — they support ten to fifty times more pollinator species than exotic ornamentals. The pathway is working when, on any day between May and September, at least two species are in flower within any twenty-meter stretch. Connect every Edible Landscape (25) to the nearest pathway with a stepping-stone planting no more than fifty meters away.**
