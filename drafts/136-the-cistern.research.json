  "notes": "Unable to perform web searches to gather verifiable evidence. Web search permission was not granted. To complete this research task properly, I would need access to search for: (1) municipal rainwater harvesting rebate programs (Austin TX, Tucson AZ, Santa Fe NM are known to have them), (2) EPA or state environmental agency statistics on stormwater capture, (3) peer-reviewed studies on cistern effectiveness, (4) case studies from built projects. Without search access, I cannot provide sourced citations and must mark evidence as thin rather than fabricate references."
