  "notes": "UNABLE TO VERIFY: Web search and fetch tools were not available during this research session. Light shelves are a well-documented daylighting strategy in architectural literature, but I cannot provide properly sourced citations without access to search tools. Known areas where evidence likely exists: (1) DOE/NREL daylighting research, (2) LBNL window and daylighting studies, (3) WBDG (Whole Building Design Guide) daylighting resources, (4) IES (Illuminating Engineering Society) standards, (5) LEED daylighting credits. Recommend re-running this research with web search permissions enabled."
