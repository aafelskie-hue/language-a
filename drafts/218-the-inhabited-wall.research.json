The 'inhabited wall' concept is well-established in architectural theory (related to 'poché' in classical architecture and the work of architects like Louis Kahn), but I cannot provide verified citations without search access. Known historical examples include Kahn's Exeter Library and traditional Pueblo architecture, but specific statistics, programs, and academic citations require web verification. Please grant WebSearch permission to complete this research task."
