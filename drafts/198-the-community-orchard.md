# 198. The Community Orchard [★]

**…beyond Common Ground (42), Green Corridors (44), and Alexander's Green Streets (51)…**

**When food production is confined to private yards, the abundant public land in parks, boulevards, and common ground produces nothing edible — ornamental trees shade the sidewalk but feed no one — and the neighborhood's food security depends entirely on supply chains that can break. Yet when individuals plant fruit trees on their own small lots, the trees often go unharvested: a single household cannot use forty kilograms of plums ripening in the same week, and the fruit rots on the ground. The abundance is wasted for lack of sharing; the public land is wasted for lack of planting.**

Alexander identified the need for "fruit trees" in his pattern *Fruit Trees* (170), arguing that orchards should be common and that fruit should hang within reach of anyone walking by. But he wrote from Berkeley, where a fig tree survives winter without protection. At 53°N, with January lows of −30°C and frost depths exceeding 1.5 meters, the species palette is narrower and the stakes are higher — a failed planting wastes years, not months.

Cold-climate orchards are possible. The University of Saskatchewan's Fruit Program, running since 1920, has bred apples, cherries, and plums hardy to Zone 2. Their 'Goodland' apple and 'Carmine Jewel' cherry now grow across the prairies. The city of Tromsø, Norway (69°N), maintains public apple trees in schoolyards and parks; the short but intense growing season — eighteen hours of summer daylight — produces fruit where theory would suggest none could grow. Edmonton's own food forest pilot at Borden Park, planted in 2012, demonstrated that serviceberries, hazelnuts, and cold-hardy apple cultivars survive and produce when sited in microclimates: south-facing slopes, windbreaks, and reflected heat from buildings.

The challenge is not horticulture but governance. Fruit trees require pruning, pest management, and organized harvest — work that a municipality's parks crew is not structured to perform and that individual volunteers do inconsistently. Philadelphia's *Philadelphia Orchard Project*, founded in 2007, solved this by pairing each orchard with a community partner — a church, school, or neighborhood association — that commits to a maintenance covenant. By 2023, the project had established over seventy orchards on formerly vacant land, producing thousands of kilograms of fruit annually. The covenant model transfers responsibility without transferring ownership; the land remains public, but the care is local.

Harvest timing matters. A community orchard of mixed species — early-ripening 'Norland' apples in August, 'Evans' cherries in July, haskap berries in June, hazelnuts in September — spreads the labor and the bounty across the short northern season. Staggered ripening prevents the glut-then-rot cycle of single-variety plantings. It also brings people back to the orchard repeatedly, building the social habit that sustains collective maintenance.

**Therefore: on every piece of common ground larger than 400 square meters — parks, schoolyards, boulevard medians, land trust parcels — plant a community orchard of at least twelve fruit or nut trees, selecting cold-hardy cultivars (Zone 3 or lower) with staggered ripening dates spanning at least eight weeks. Site the orchard to capture a south-facing microclimate where possible: against a building's thermal mass, on a gentle slope, or sheltered by an evergreen windbreak. Pair each orchard with a named community partner — a residents' association, school, or congregation — who signs a five-year maintenance covenant covering pruning, pest monitoring, and harvest coordination. The orchard is complete when a resident can walk from any home in the neighborhood to a fruiting tree in under five minutes, and when the harvest is distributed, not rotting on the ground.**
