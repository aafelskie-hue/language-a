  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research due to permission restrictions. I cannot verify citations or search for real evidence. Based on my training knowledge, shared workshops exist in cohousing communities (like those in the Cohousing Association directory), tool libraries operate in many cities (Berkeley Tool Library, West Seattle Tool Library, Toronto Tool Library), and makerspaces are documented - but I cannot provide verified URLs, current statistics, or confirm these sources are still accurate as of 2026. To properly research this pattern, web search access is required. The pattern concept is well-established in cohousing literature, but I refuse to fabricate specific citations or statistics without verification."
