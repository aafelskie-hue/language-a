# 168. The Density Transition [★]

**…beyond Walkable Density Gradient (40), Suburban Densification (29), and Incremental Development (100)…**

**When high-density buildings meet low-density neighborhoods without mediation, the abruptness creates fear, shadows, and political resistance. The four-story building beside the bungalow becomes a symbol of intrusion rather than growth. Yet density must go somewhere — and the edges where transit corridors meet established neighborhoods are precisely where it belongs. The question is not whether to add density, but how to make its arrival feel like a natural slope rather than a cliff.**

Alexander understood this in pattern 29 (Density Rings), where he observed that "people are unable to accept high-density living if it is right beside low-density living." He proposed rings of density, each ring five to ten percent denser than the one outside it, so that transitions happen gradually enough to feel continuous. But he left the specific geometry vague — how wide should each step be? How much height difference is tolerable at a property line?

Vancouver's RS-1 to RM-4 transition zones offer one tested answer. Along arterials like Cambie Street, the city requires that buildings within thirty meters of single-family zones step back one story for every six meters of proximity. A four-story building at the lot line facing the arterial becomes three stories at twelve meters back, two stories at eighteen meters, and single-story volumes at the rear. The 2016 Cambie Corridor Plan documented resident acceptance rates: neighborhoods with stepback requirements saw sixty-two percent support for rezoning, versus thirty-one percent where buildings rose abruptly to full height.

Portland's "d" overlay zones, established in 1991 and refined through 2019, require a forty-five-degree angular plane from the property line of adjacent lower-density zones. Any building mass above the first story must fit within this invisible sloped envelope. The effect is visible along Division Street, where four-story mixed-use buildings angle backward as they approach the detached houses behind them. Portland's Bureau of Planning found that developments complying with the angular plane received half as many design review objections and moved through permitting forty percent faster than those requesting variances.

Edmonton's own experience is instructive in the negative. The Belgravia neighborhood's 2018 confrontation with a proposed six-story building on 76th Avenue drew three hundred residents to a public hearing. The building's rear wall would have risen six stories at the property line shared with single-family homes — a twenty-meter wall of windows overlooking backyard gardens. The project was eventually reduced to four stories with a stepped rear, but the conflict cost two years and generated lasting mistrust. By contrast, the Garneau area's 2021 transition zone, requiring one-meter setbacks per story above the second, has seen four mid-rise projects proceed with minimal opposition.

The mathematics of shadow matter as much as psychology. At Edmonton's latitude (53°N), a four-story building casts a noon shadow of approximately twelve meters at the winter solstice. A six-story building casts eighteen meters. The difference between a shadow that ends at your property line and one that reaches your kitchen window is the difference between acceptable and intolerable. The stepback isn't merely aesthetic — it keeps winter sun on adjacent gardens.

**Therefore: where buildings of four or more stories meet zones of two stories or less, require a transition zone at least fifteen meters deep. Within this zone, building height must step down by one story for every five meters of proximity to the lower-density zone, and upper stories must fit within a forty-five-degree angular plane drawn from the property line at a height of six meters. No wall facing the lower-density zone may exceed ten meters in height without a setback of at least three meters. Test by drawing the angular plane on section: if any part of the building penetrates it, the transition fails.**
