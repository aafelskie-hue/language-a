  "notes": "Unable to verify evidence - web search permissions not granted. Sound-absorbing surfaces are well-documented in acoustics literature (NRC/SAA ratings are standard measures, WHO has noise guidelines, GSA P100 standards exist), but I cannot provide specific citations without the ability to search and verify current sources. The underlying acoustic science is well-established - porous materials absorb sound energy through friction as air molecules move through material - but specific program/study citations require search access."
