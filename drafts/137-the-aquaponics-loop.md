# 137. The Aquaponics Loop [★]

**…beyond The Food Forest (132) and The Four-Season Greenhouse (24)…**

**When food production and water management operate as separate systems, each demands external inputs that the other could provide. The fish tank requires constant water changes to flush away ammonia; the hydroponic bed requires purchased fertilizer to feed the plants. Meanwhile, the greywater system treats nutrient-rich water as waste, and the garden bed sits dry between waterings. Two closed loops, each incomplete, each bleeding resources that the other needs.**

The basic biology is simple and ancient. Fish excrete ammonia. Bacteria convert ammonia to nitrite, then to nitrate. Plants absorb nitrate as fertilizer and return clean water to the fish. The loop closes. What makes aquaponics distinct from keeping a fish tank beside a garden is the integration: the same water circulates continuously through both systems, with bacteria as the invisible third partner.

The University of the Virgin Islands developed the first large-scale research aquaponics system in the 1980s, demonstrating that tilapia and lettuce could be raised together with 90% less water than conventional agriculture. Their system produced 5 kg of vegetables per square meter per year while simultaneously raising fish for protein. The key metric: water loss came only from evaporation and plant transpiration — roughly 1-2% of system volume per day — rather than the constant discharge required by separate aquaculture and hydroponics.

Commercial operations have since validated the approach at scale. Growing Power in Milwaukee operated urban aquaponics greenhouses from 1993 to 2017, producing over 450 kg of tilapia and 4,500 kg of vegetables annually in a single 930-square-meter facility. Their system integrated worm composting to supplement fish waste with additional nutrients — a practical acknowledgment that aquaponics alone may not provide all the trace minerals plants require. The FAO's 2014 technical paper on small-scale aquaponics documented successful installations across climate zones, noting that systems perform best when fish tank volume, grow bed area, and fish stocking density are balanced: roughly 1 kg of fish per 40-60 liters of water, with 1-2 square meters of grow bed per 500 liters of fish tank.

In Edmonton's climate, the aquaponics loop must live inside The Four-Season Greenhouse (24) — the fish require water temperatures above 15°C year-round, which outdoor systems cannot maintain through winter. This constraint becomes an advantage: the water mass provides thermal storage, the plants humidify the greenhouse air, and the fish provide a protein source during months when even the most cold-hardy greens grow slowly. The system transforms the greenhouse from seasonal vegetable production into year-round food infrastructure.

Alexander wrote of gardens that give back — places where the household's attention is repaid with abundance. The aquaponics loop extends this logic to protein. The loop is working when the fish feed the plants, the plants clean the water, and the household eats from both.

**Therefore: within any greenhouse or indoor growing space, install a recirculating aquaponics system with a fish tank of at least 500 liters, connected to grow beds totaling at least 2 square meters of planted area. Stock the tank with edible fish — tilapia, perch, or trout depending on your temperature regime — at no more than 20 kg of fish per 1,000 liters of water. Cycle water continuously from fish tank through grow beds and back at a rate that turns over the full tank volume once per hour. Test ammonia and nitrate weekly during the first three months; the system is established when ammonia stays below 0.5 ppm while plants show healthy growth. The system is succeeding when, after one year of operation, the only inputs are fish food and occasional top-up water — no fertilizers, no water changes, no waste stream.**
