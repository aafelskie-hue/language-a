The pattern concept ('envelope first' retrofit sequencing) is well-established in building science literature, but I cannot cite specific programs, statistics, or studies without verification access. Known relevant sources to investigate include: NRCan Canada Greener Homes program, Building Science Corporation publications (particularly Joe Lstiburek's work), Passive House Institute EnerPHit standards, and RMI (Rocky Mountain Institute) deep retrofit research. Please grant WebSearch permission to complete this research properly."
