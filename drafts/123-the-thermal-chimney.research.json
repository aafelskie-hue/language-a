The examples listed are from my training data but I CANNOT verify current statistics, programs, or academic studies without search access. The Eastgate Centre claim of 90% energy savings is frequently cited but I cannot locate the primary source. This response should be considered PLACEHOLDER ONLY until proper web research can be conducted. Do not use these citations without independent verification."
