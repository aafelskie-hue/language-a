# 166. The Narrow Frontage [★]

**…beyond Incremental Development (100), The Local Street (43), and The Missing Middle (12)…**

**When lots are wide — thirty, forty, fifty feet — each building becomes a project: expensive to acquire, slow to develop, requiring deep pockets and patient capital. The street fills with sameness because only large developers can afford to play. But when lots are narrow, every building demands more entrances, more decisions about where to place the door, more variation in how the façade meets the street. The economics of narrow frontage enable small builders; the geometry of narrow frontage demands visual richness. These forces pull against the suburban default of wide lots that simplify construction but deaden streets.**

Amsterdam's canal houses, built on plots typically 5 to 7 meters wide (16 to 23 feet), arose from a 17th-century tax system that charged by frontage width. The constraint produced one of the world's most beloved streetscapes — tall, narrow buildings with individuated gables, each façade a distinct composition yet harmonious with its neighbors. The city's 7,000 canal houses, built over 150 years by hundreds of different owners and builders, demonstrate how narrow lots produce variety without chaos.

In North America, the pattern appears wherever pre-automobile building survived. Charleston's single houses — one room wide, oriented with the narrow end to the street — fit on lots as slim as 25 feet. Philadelphia's rowhouses, San Francisco's Painted Ladies, Montreal's triplexes: all share frontages between 15 and 25 feet. The Strong Towns organization has documented how these "fine-grained" streetscapes generate more tax revenue per acre than suburban development — in Asheville, North Carolina, a block of narrow-lot mixed-use buildings produced $634 per square foot of land value compared to $6.50 for a big-box store with parking.

Houston's 2013 small-lot ordinance allowed single-family homes on lots as narrow as 1,400 square feet, roughly 25 by 56 feet. By 2019, the city had permitted over 15,000 such homes, many in formerly declining neighborhoods. The narrow lots enabled small builders and individual buyers to participate in construction that would otherwise require assembling larger parcels. Prices ran 20 to 30 percent below comparable homes on standard lots, creating an affordability pathway that didn't require subsidy.

Alexander captured part of this in Pattern 109, Long Thin House, which argues that narrow buildings with light on both long sides produce better rooms than deep, dark buildings. But he focused on the building's interior; the pattern here concerns the street. When every building is narrow, the pedestrian passes more entrances, more windows, more changes in material and detail per minute of walking. Jan Gehl's research in Copenhagen found that pedestrians walk faster and look less at façades when buildings exceed 15 meters (50 feet) in width — the street becomes boring enough to rush through rather than linger in.

The narrow frontage also enables The Demountable Partition (169) to work at the neighborhood scale: when party walls are close together, combining or dividing units horizontally — linking two narrow buildings or splitting one into flats — becomes structurally simpler than reconfiguring deep buildings. The lot becomes a module, like a cell in a larger organism, capable of subdivision, combination, and adaptation over time.

**Therefore: wherever zoning permits attached or closely spaced buildings, allow and encourage frontages of 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters). Design the lot pattern so that a single small building can occupy a single lot — no land assembly required. At this width, the building will naturally produce one or two rooms across, generous light, and a façade that must be considered as a vertical composition. Test: walking along the block at 5 km/h, a pedestrian should pass a new entrance or major façade break every 4 seconds — roughly 20 feet.**
