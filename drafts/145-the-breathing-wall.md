# 145. The Breathing Wall [★]

**…beyond Air Quality by Design (31) and Air Sealing Strategy (130)…**

**When walls are sealed tight for energy efficiency, they stop air movement — which is essential — but they also risk trapping the moisture that occupants generate through breathing, cooking, and bathing. A family of four produces 10 to 15 liters of water vapor per day. If that vapor cannot escape through the wall assembly, it condenses on cold surfaces inside the wall cavity, soaking insulation, feeding mold, and rotting structure. The forces conflict: seal the wall to stop air leakage, but let it breathe to release moisture. Block liquid water from outside, but allow vapor to diffuse outward. The wall must be both tight and permeable — a membrane, not a tomb.**

The physics are straightforward but widely misunderstood. Air leakage and vapor diffusion are different mechanisms. Air carries bulk moisture through holes and cracks — a single gap around an electrical box can deposit liters of water in a wall cavity during a cold winter. Vapor diffusion moves molecule by molecule through materials, driven by differences in vapor pressure. In a cold climate like Edmonton, the vapor drive is almost always from warm interior to cold exterior: the inside of the house is humid, the outside is dry, and moisture wants to migrate outward through any pathway it can find.

The traditional solution — a 6-mil polyethylene vapor barrier on the warm side of the wall — stops this diffusion completely. In theory, this prevents moisture from entering the wall cavity. In practice, it creates two problems. First, any moisture that does enter the cavity — through air leaks, construction moisture, or inward vapor drive during summer air-conditioning — cannot escape. The wall becomes a trap. Second, polyethylene has no intelligence: it blocks vapor equally in all directions, regardless of conditions. Research at the Building Envelope and Structure Program at the National Research Council of Canada, conducted by Kumaran and others through the 1990s and 2000s, demonstrated that walls with vapor-variable membranes — "smart" retarders that become more permeable when humidity rises — outperformed conventional polyethylene assemblies in both laboratory and field testing. The Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics in Germany developed similar findings, showing that hygric redistribution — the ability of materials to absorb, store, and release moisture — is essential for long-term wall durability.

The alternative is a wall that manages moisture through material selection rather than sealing. The Building Science Corporation's "perfect wall" concept, developed by Joseph Lstiburek, places all control layers — air barrier, vapor retarder, thermal insulation — outboard of the structure, allowing the interior to dry inward freely. In Edmonton's climate, this translates to exterior rigid insulation over a taped sheathing air barrier, with no interior polyethylene. The sheathing — plywood or OSB — acts as a smart vapor retarder, becoming more permeable as it takes on moisture. Hygroscopic interior finishes — lime plaster, clay plaster, untreated wood — buffer humidity swings and release moisture back to the room during dry periods. The wall breathes: it resists liquid water and air movement, but it allows vapor to migrate slowly outward in winter and inward in summer, never trapping moisture long enough for damage.

This is not a call to abandon air sealing. The blower door test remains essential — a wall must still achieve 1.5 ACH50 or better. But the materials that block air need not block vapor. Taped sheathing, fluid-applied membranes, and European air-tight tapes can create a continuous air barrier while remaining vapor-open. The key is to place vapor-retarding layers appropriately — toward the warm side in winter, but permeable enough to allow drying.

**Therefore: design every wall assembly so that vapor permeance increases from interior to exterior — each successive layer more open than the last. Use a vapor-variable membrane or vapor-open air barrier rather than polyethylene on the warm side. Specify hygroscopic interior finishes — lime plaster, clay plaster, or unsealed wood — that buffer humidity and release moisture to the room. On the exterior, use vapor-open weather barriers (minimum 1,400 ng/Pa·s·m²) that shed liquid water but allow vapor diffusion. Test the assembly using the dew point method: model the temperature gradient through the wall under January design conditions (-30°C exterior, +21°C interior, 40% RH) and confirm that no layer reaches its dew point under steady-state conditions. The wall should dry to the outside in winter and to the inside in summer — never trapping moisture in any season.**
