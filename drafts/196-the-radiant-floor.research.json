Radiant floor heating is a well-established technology with substantial research literature, but I cannot cite specific sources without the ability to verify them. Known reliable sources to check manually: U.S. DOE Energy Saver (energy.gov), ASHRAE Handbook chapters on radiant heating, Natural Resources Canada publications, and academic databases for peer-reviewed studies on thermal comfort and energy efficiency."
