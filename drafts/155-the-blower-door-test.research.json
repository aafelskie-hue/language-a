I have general knowledge about blower door testing (e.g., Passive House requires ≤0.6 ACH50, ENERGY STAR has airtightness requirements, Canadian R-2000 program pioneered mandatory testing in 1982), but I cannot provide properly sourced citations without the ability to verify current URLs and specific statistics. Please grant WebSearch permission and re-run this query to get verified evidence with proper sources."
