  "notes": "Unable to perform web searches to gather verifiable evidence. The principle that light-colored surfaces increase interior illumination through reflection is well-established in building physics (higher surface reflectance = more light bounced deeper into rooms), and Scandinavian design traditions do emphasize light interiors. However, without web search access, I cannot provide: (1) specific program citations with outcomes, (2) statistics with proper source attribution, (3) academic studies with full citations, or (4) documented built examples with measurable results. The underlying physics is sound - a white wall reflects ~80% of light while a dark wall may reflect only ~10-20% - but I cannot ethically fabricate specific citations. This pattern should be researched with web access enabled, or marked with low confidence until proper evidence is gathered."
