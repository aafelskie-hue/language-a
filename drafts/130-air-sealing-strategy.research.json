  "notes": "CRITICAL: I was unable to perform web searches to verify this evidence. The information above is based on my training knowledge of building science principles, which are well-established. However, specific statistics, program details, and citations MUST be verified through actual web searches before publication. The underlying science of air sealing is robust and well-documented in building science literature. Please re-run this research task with web search permissions enabled."
