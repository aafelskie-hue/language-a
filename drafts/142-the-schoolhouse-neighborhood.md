# 142. The Schoolhouse Neighborhood [★]

**…beyond THE ADAPTIVE REUSE TOOLKIT (138), SCHOOLS IN WALKING DISTANCE (76), THE THIRD PLACE NETWORK (2), and PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING SPACE (51)…**

**When a neighborhood school closes — enrollment fallen, building deemed surplus — the community loses its most familiar public building: the gymnasium where parents gathered, the auditorium where children performed, the playground that belonged to everyone after hours. The district wants to sell. Developers see the land. But the building was designed for exactly what the neighborhood still needs: spaces where people gather, learn, and belong. The tension is this: the school as an institution has failed, but the school as a building — with its high ceilings, its gymnasium, its rooms sized for thirty — remains exactly suited to the mixed life of a neighborhood. Demolition erases both. Preservation without program creates a monument to loss. The building must find new life, but that life must honor what the building was built to do.**

Chicago closed 49 schools in 2013. By 2019, the Chicago Tribune reported that only 12 had been converted to productive use; 22 sat vacant, decaying. The conversions that succeeded shared a pattern: they mixed housing with community space and kept some public function alive. The Manierre School in Cabrini-Green became 79 apartments plus a community center in the former gymnasium. In Philadelphia, the Kensington Creative and Performing Arts High School closed in 2013 and reopened in 2017 as KIPP Philadelphia, keeping educational use. But elsewhere, the Point Breeze Performing Arts Center — a former school — became 27 apartments with no community space, and neighbors reported feeling the loss of the auditorium more than the gain of the units.

The geometry of old schools makes them good candidates for housing. Corridors are typically 2.4 to 3 meters wide — generous by residential standards. Classrooms are usually 7 by 9 meters with windows on one wall, easily divisible into studio or one-bedroom units. Ceiling heights of 3.3 to 4 meters allow mezzanine sleeping lofts, as OFFICE-TO-HOUSING CONVERSION (27) describes for deep-plate office buildings. The challenges differ: schools have fewer plumbing risers than offices, but more exterior windows; schools have gymnasiums and auditoriums that offices lack.

Alexander, in COMMUNITY OF 7000 (12), argued that neighborhoods need identifiable institutions at their heart — but he wrote when schools were expanding, not contracting. His SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE (81) called for small-scale social services distributed through neighborhoods. A converted school can provide both: the building's identity anchors the neighborhood's memory, while its large common spaces — gymnasium, cafeteria, auditorium — can house the small services and third places that Alexander sought. The conversion succeeds when it preserves these irreplaceable volumes for shared use while wrapping housing around them.

The economics turn on the gymnasium and auditorium. A gymnasium floor is typically 25 by 40 meters, clear-span, with 7-meter ceilings — impossible to replicate at today's construction costs. Detroit's Kettering High School conversion in 2019 kept the gymnasium as a community recreation center, which allowed the developer to qualify for community development block grant funding and reduced the housing subsidy needed by 22%. The gymnasium became the project's anchor tenant, drawing neighbors back to a building they had written off.

**Therefore: when converting a closed school to housing, preserve the gymnasium, auditorium, or cafeteria — whichever is the largest clear-span volume — as permanently dedicated community space, owned or leased by a community land trust, neighborhood association, or municipal recreation department. Convert classrooms along exterior walls to housing units, using the existing window walls and adding mezzanine lofts where ceiling heights exceed 3.3 meters. Cluster new kitchens and bathrooms along the original corridor walls where plumbing can be consolidated. Keep the main entrance and lobby as a shared threshold serving both housing and community uses. The conversion is right when the gymnasium or auditorium remains publicly accessible at least 40 hours per week — for recreation, meetings, performances, or civic gatherings — and wrong when the largest volume has been subdivided, privatized, or demolished.**
