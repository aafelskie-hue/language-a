# 209. The Daylit Stair [☆]

**…beyond The Forest Bathing Path (208), The Four-Story Maximum (98), and Universal Wayfinding (81)…**

**When a building needs vertical circulation, it faces a conflict: stairs are the healthier, more social, more human way to move between floors — but fire codes demand enclosure, security demands control, and cost demands efficiency. The result, almost always, is a dark fire stair hidden behind a heavy door while the elevator gleams in the lobby. People who would gladly walk three flights instead shuffle into a metal box because the alternative feels like punishment.**

The problem is not that people are lazy. The problem is that we have made the healthy choice feel institutional. A concrete shaft with fluorescent tubes and echoing metal treads triggers every instinct that says "emergency exit only." The elevator, by contrast, stands at the building's social center, visible, warm, waiting. We have designed stair avoidance into our buildings and then blamed the occupants.

Alexander, in Pattern 133 (Staircase as a Stage), understood that stairs could be more than circulation — they could be places of encounter, display, and drama. But his concern was primarily social and aesthetic. The health dimension has since become measurable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in their guidance on physical activity, identify stair climbing as one of the most accessible forms of daily exercise — requiring no equipment, no change of clothes, no time set aside. A person who climbs three flights twice a day accumulates meaningful cardiovascular benefit over months and years. The challenge is not motivation but environment: people take the stairs when the stairs invite them.

New York City's Active Design Guidelines, developed by the Center for Active Design beginning in 2010, established a principle now replicated in wellness building standards worldwide: make stairs visible, make them pleasant, and people will use them. The guidelines recommend placing stairs in prominent locations, providing views to the outside or into occupied spaces, and ensuring natural light reaches the treads. Buildings that followed these principles — including several in the NYC portfolio — reported increased stair use compared to conventional layouts. The mechanism is not subtle: when you can see daylight from the stair landing, when you pass a window on the way up, when the stair feels like part of the building rather than a hidden service passage, it becomes a reasonable choice rather than a last resort.

The WELL Building Standard, in its Movement concept, awards points for stairs that are visible from the main entrance, that have at least one window or skylight providing natural light, and that include finishes warmer than bare concrete. These are not arbitrary amenities. They address the psychological reality that dark, enclosed spaces feel unsafe, unpleasant, and institutional — especially to women, to the elderly, to anyone who has ever hurried through a parking garage at night. A daylit stair reverses the calculation. It becomes the route you choose.

In Edmonton, where winter light is scarce and precious, a south-facing stair with clerestory glazing can capture low-angle sun for months when it would otherwise never reach interior spaces. The stair becomes not merely tolerable but desirable — a place where light pools, where you pause at the landing to look out at snow falling, where the climb is a small gift rather than a chore. This is the deeper principle: stairs should not compete with elevators by being faster or more convenient. They compete by being *better* — more alive, more connected to the day, more human.

**Therefore: in every building of two to four stories, place at least one stair where it is visible from the main entrance and receives natural light on at least two levels — through windows, skylights, or clerestories. The stair should have a view to the outside or into an occupied room from at least one landing. Finish the treads and walls with materials warmer than bare concrete. Test: from the building entrance, can you see daylight through the stair enclosure? On a sunny day, can you climb from ground to top floor without passing through a space that requires artificial light? If yes, the stair will compete with the elevator.**
