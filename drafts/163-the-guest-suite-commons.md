# 163. The Guest Suite Commons [★]

**…beyond Common Storage (95) and Shared Laundry (93)…**

**When every dwelling must maintain a guest bedroom for visitors who come a few times a year, that room sits empty three hundred nights annually — yet when guests do arrive, they occupy an awkward space in the household's daily rhythms, sleeping on a sofa bed in the living room or displacing a child from their bedroom. The guest room is either always there and rarely used, or never there and always needed.**

The arithmetic is stark. A modest spare bedroom in Edmonton consumes 10 to 12 square meters of conditioned floor space. At construction costs of $3,000 to $4,000 per square meter for multi-unit residential, that room represents $30,000 to $48,000 in capital cost per household — for a space used perhaps twenty nights per year. In a fifty-unit building, this totals $1.5 to $2.4 million in construction for rooms that sit empty 95 percent of the time.

Cohousing communities have understood this for decades. The cohousing model, developed in Denmark in the 1960s and brought to North America by Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett in the 1980s, treats guest accommodation as a shared amenity rather than private redundancy. Muir Commons in Davis, California (1991) — the first cohousing community built in the United States — included guest rooms in its common house from the beginning. Residents book the space when needed, typically for a modest nightly fee that covers linens and cleaning. The same pattern appears in cohousing across Scandinavia, Germany, and increasingly in North American projects: a hotel-quality room that serves fifty households instead of fifty underused bedrooms serving one household each.

The benefits extend beyond economics. A guest suite in a separate building offers something a spare bedroom cannot: genuine privacy for both host and visitor. The elderly parent visiting for two weeks has their own front door, their own schedule, their own space to retreat to. The host household maintains its routines. The visit becomes easier — and therefore more likely. Alexander understood related dynamics in his pattern for The Multigenerational Suite (14): the lockable door between zones allows intimacy without intrusion. The Guest Suite Commons applies this same principle at the neighborhood scale.

The suite must be more than a hotel room. It needs a small kitchenette — a sink, a kettle, a refrigerator, a microwave — so guests can make their own breakfast without imposing on their hosts. It needs a bathroom with a proper shower, not a shared facility down the hall. It needs a comfortable bed, good lighting for reading, a place to hang clothes, a desk or table for a laptop. Natural light is essential — this is a room where someone might spend a sick day recovering from travel, or a rainy afternoon reading while their hosts are at work. In buildings that include a Care Suite (80), consider locating the guest suite nearby: the same accessibility features that serve a recovering family member serve an elderly guest, and the guest suite can house visiting family during a medical crisis.

**Therefore: in any multi-unit building of twenty households or more, provide at least one bookable guest suite — a self-contained room of 18 to 25 square meters with a queen bed, a private bathroom with shower, a kitchenette, good natural light, and a separate entrance or private hallway access. For larger buildings, provide one suite per thirty to forty units. Locate the suite within two minutes' walk of all units it serves. Include a simple booking system and clear policies for cleaning and turnover. The test: a resident's parent arriving for a two-week visit should be able to live comfortably in the suite without entering the resident's home except by invitation — and without either party feeling they are imposing on the other.**
