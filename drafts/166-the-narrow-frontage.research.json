To properly research this pattern, I would need to search for: (1) Amsterdam's historical narrow house frontages and tax-based origins, (2) Strong Towns and Congress for New Urbanism research on fine-grained development, (3) Houston's small lot ordinance (2013) and similar policies, (4) Academic literature on lot width and streetscape quality, (5) Japanese machiya and other traditional narrow-frontage building typologies. Please re-run this research task with web search permissions enabled."
