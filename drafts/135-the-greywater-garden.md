# 135. The Greywater Garden [☆]

**…beyond The Food Forest (132), Greywater Loop (65), and The Edible Landscape (25)…**

**When greywater from showers, sinks, and laundry flows to the sewer, clean water must be purchased to irrigate the garden, nutrients that could feed plants are wasted in treatment, and the household loses the chance to close its water loop. Yet when greywater is simply dumped on plants, soaps and salts accumulate, roots suffer, and what seemed like conservation becomes contamination.**

The average North American household produces 150 to 200 liters of greywater daily — enough to irrigate 50 to 100 square meters of garden through the growing season. California's greywater code, revised in 2009, permits direct subsurface irrigation without a permit for single-family homes using laundry-to-landscape systems, recognizing that greywater distributed below mulch poses minimal health risk and substantial water savings. Arizona has allowed residential greywater irrigation since 2001, requiring only that the water be released below grade and not pooled on the surface.

The key is the planted filter: a bed of deep-rooted, nutrient-hungry plants growing in mulched soil that receives greywater through perforated pipes buried 15 to 30 centimeters below the surface. The soil biome — bacteria, fungi, and root systems — breaks down soaps and processes nutrients before they reach groundwater. Art Ludwig, whose *Create an Oasis with Greywater* has guided thousands of installations since 1995, documents that properly designed systems show no salt buildup after a decade of use, provided the household uses plant-compatible soaps and the garden receives occasional rainfall or freshwater flushing.

In Australia, where water scarcity drove early adoption, the national Guidelines for the Use of Greywater (2006) established a framework now used across arid regions: greywater must be applied subsurface, must not run off the property, and must irrigate plants tolerant of the soap and nutrient load. The Earthship buildings of Taos, New Mexico, take this further, routing all greywater through interior "botanical cells" — greenhouse planters that treat the water before it irrigates exterior food gardens. These systems, operating since the 1970s, demonstrate that greywater can support food production when filtered through ornamental plants first.

The pattern works in cold climates only seasonally. In Edmonton, where the ground freezes from November through March, winter greywater must bypass the garden and flow to the sewer — exactly as Greywater Loop (65) specifies. The garden receives water only during the May-to-September growing season, roughly 150 days. Even so, a household producing 175 liters daily provides over 26,000 liters of irrigation water — more than enough for a 50-square-meter garden that would otherwise require municipal water or go unwatered in dry summers.

Alexander did not address greywater directly, though his Natural Swimming Pool (Alexander 71) shows water treated by plants rather than chemicals, and his Vegetable Garden (Alexander 177) assumes irrigation without specifying its source. The Greywater Garden bridges this gap: it is the system that connects the water leaving the house to the food entering it.

**Therefore: where Greywater Loop (65) separates grey from black water, route the greywater to a planted garden bed through perforated pipes buried 20 centimeters below a thick mulch layer. Size the garden at 0.5 to 1 square meter per 10 liters of daily greywater flow — roughly 10 to 20 square meters for a typical household. Plant it with deep-rooted, nutrient-hungry species: fruit trees, berry bushes, or perennial vegetables that tolerate the moisture and welcome the phosphorus and nitrogen in soap residue. Use only plant-compatible detergents — no boron, no sodium salts, no chlorine bleach. In cold climates, install a diverter valve to bypass the garden during frozen months. The test: after three growing seasons, soil samples from the irrigated bed should show no significant increase in sodium or boron compared to adjacent unirrigated soil.**
