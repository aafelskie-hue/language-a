  "notes": "Unable to conduct web research - web search and fetch tools are not available. Cannot provide verifiable evidence without the ability to search for real sources. While community mediation centers, restorative justice circles, and conflict resolution spaces do exist (e.g., community mediation programs in many US cities, Maori-inspired restorative justice practices in New Zealand, courthouse mediation rooms), I cannot cite specific statistics, studies, or outcomes without confirming them through actual search. This pattern likely has moderate-to-strong real-world evidence available, but it requires web access to verify. Recommend re-running this research task with web search permissions enabled."
