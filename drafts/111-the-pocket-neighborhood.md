# 111. The Pocket Neighborhood [★]

**…beyond COMMON GROUND (42) and THE COURTYARD CLUSTER (96)…**

**When small houses are built on their own individual lots, each dwelling must provide for itself — its own garden, its own parking, its own tool storage, its own gathering space. The result is that small houses feel deprived: the 50-square-meter cottage on its own lot has a cramped yard, no guest parking, no space for a shared meal with neighbors. But when the same small houses are clustered together around a shared commons, the total land area is used more efficiently, and each resident gains access to amenities no individual small lot could provide. The tension is this: people choose small houses for affordability and simplicity, but isolated small houses lack the generous outdoor space, social infrastructure, and practical amenities that make modest living sustainable over time.**

The pocket neighborhood — a cluster of small cottages arranged around a shared courtyard or green — emerged as a deliberate housing type in the 1990s. The City of Langley, Washington (population 1,100), adopted one of the first cottage housing ordinances in 1995, permitting clusters of small detached dwellings arranged around common open space. Seattle followed in 2006, allowing cottage housing developments in single-family zones with a density bonus: builders could exceed base density if individual units stayed below 92 square meters. The regulations required that at least 50% of dwelling units face a common open space of at least 280 square meters.

The built examples tell the story most clearly. Third Street Cottages in Langley, completed in 1997 and designed by Ross Chapin Architects, arranged eight cottages of 65 to 90 square meters around a 200-square-meter central green. Each cottage has its own front porch facing the commons, its own small private yard at the rear, and parking is relegated to a shared lot at the periphery. Chapin documented the social patterns that emerged: neighbors gathering on the green for evening meals, children moving freely between yards, tool-sharing and informal childcare arising without formal organization. His 2011 book *Pocket Neighborhoods: Creating Small-Scale Community in a Large-Scale World* recorded these observations across dozens of developments, though it remains practitioner documentation rather than independent research.

The spatial logic is simple and ancient. Alexander identified it in HOUSE CLUSTER (37): "People will not feel comfortable in their houses unless a group of houses forms a cluster, with the public land between them jointly owned by all the householders." The pocket neighborhood applies this principle at a specific scale — typically four to twelve cottages of 45 to 100 square meters each, on a single legal lot, with shared gardens, parking, and infrastructure. The single-lot structure solves a zoning problem: in most jurisdictions, each dwelling requires its own lot, its own setbacks, its own services. The pocket neighborhood places multiple dwellings on one lot, governed by condominium or cooperative ownership, bypassing the lot-by-lot fragmentation that makes small-house neighborhoods inefficient.

The shared commons is not a leftover; it is the organizing principle. In the best examples, the courtyard is sized and shaped so that you can recognize your neighbor's face from your front porch — close enough for casual greeting, far enough for privacy. Chapin's rule of thumb: the commons should be 20 to 35 meters across, small enough to feel enclosed but large enough for a gathering of all residents.

**Therefore: cluster four to twelve small dwellings — each 45 to 100 square meters — around a shared commons of at least 150 square meters, on a single legal lot. Arrange the dwellings so that every front door faces the commons, within 35 meters of the farthest dwelling. Place parking at the edge, never within the commons. Provide each dwelling with at least 10 square meters of private outdoor space — a patio, a fenced yard — in addition to the shared commons. The cluster passes the test if a person standing at any front door can see the front doors of at least half the other dwellings.**
