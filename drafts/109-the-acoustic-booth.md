# 109. The Acoustic Booth [★]

**…beyond THE ZOOM ROOM (7), SOUND GRADIENT (90), and THE HOME OFFICE THRESHOLD (5)…**

**When video calls happen in shared spaces, the household loses its freedom — children are shushed, partners whisper, the television goes dark. But a dedicated room for calls, as described in THE ZOOM ROOM (7), costs floor area that many dwellings cannot spare. The tension is between acoustic isolation and spatial economy: a full room provides the sound barrier but wastes space during the twenty-three hours when no call is happening; an open desk saves space but leaks sound in both directions.**

The commercial office world discovered this tension a decade ago. Open-plan offices, which dominated workplace design from 2010 onward, promised collaboration but delivered distraction. Steelcase's 2017 global workplace survey of 12,480 workers across 17 countries found that only 11% of employees were highly satisfied with their work environment, with noise identified as the leading complaint. The response was the phone booth: a freestanding acoustic enclosure, typically 1.0 to 1.5 square meters in floor area, with STC 30-35 walls, ventilation, lighting, and power. Framery, a Finnish manufacturer founded in 2010, had by 2022 installed over 100,000 such pods in offices worldwide. Room (formerly Telephone Booth), Zenbooth, and dozens of competitors followed. The form became ubiquitous in corporate interiors because it solved a specific problem: a call requires acoustic isolation, but not for long, and not with much space.

The home presents the same problem in compressed form. A 2021 survey by the American Institute of Architects found that 61% of residential clients requested dedicated home office space — but the median new single-family home in the United States offers 230 square meters, and carving out a full room for occasional calls competes with bedrooms, storage, and living space. The booth form factor — standing or seated, 0.8 to 1.5 square meters, heavily insulated — offers a different trade: maximum acoustic isolation in minimum floor area, deployable in a corner, a closet conversion, or a garage.

Alexander did not anticipate this pattern. His WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE (183) assumes a full room; his ALCOVES (179) provides spatial definition but not acoustic separation. The acoustic booth fills a gap that emerged only when video calls became a daily ritual and housing costs made dedicated rooms unaffordable for many households. The critical performance threshold is speech privacy: a person speaking at normal volume inside the booth should not be intelligible outside it, and household noise outside should not appear on the microphone inside. This requires walls with STC 30 minimum — roughly the performance of a well-sealed solid-core door — plus a ceiling, ventilation that does not create a flanking path, and gaskets on all joints.

The construction is simple: a frame of 2×4 lumber or steel studs, two layers of 16mm gypsum board with Green Glue damping compound between them, acoustic insulation in the cavity, a solid-core door with perimeter gaskets, and a small silent fan ducted to an adjacent space. Interior dimensions of 1.0m × 1.2m accommodate a chair, a small shelf, and a camera-neutral background. A hardwired ethernet connection and two electrical outlets complete the infrastructure. The booth can be built into a closet, a corner of a basement, or as a freestanding unit in a garage or spare room. It need not be beautiful — but if it includes one HAND-MADE DETAIL (106), a carved door pull or a hand-thrown hook for headphones, it becomes a place rather than an appliance.

**Therefore: in any dwelling where regular video calls occur but a full ZOOM ROOM (7) is impractical, build an acoustic booth of 0.8 to 1.5 square meters — enough for one seated person, a small surface, and a neutral background. Construct the walls to achieve STC 30 or better: double gypsum board with damping compound, insulated cavity, gaskets on the door. Provide ventilation, lighting, power, and ethernet. The test: with a person speaking at normal volume inside the closed booth, a listener standing one meter outside cannot understand the words.**

**…this pattern connects to THE HAND-MADE DETAIL (106), THE TOOL WALL (107), and SEASONAL MAINTENANCE RITUAL (108)…**
