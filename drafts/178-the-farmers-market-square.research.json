To properly research this pattern, I would need permission to use WebSearch to find current statistics from USDA, Farmers Market Coalition, Project for Public Spaces, and academic databases. The topic itself (farmers markets and public market squares) has substantial real-world documentation, but I cannot cite it without verification. Please grant web search permissions and re-run this research task."
