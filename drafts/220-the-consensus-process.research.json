To complete this research properly, I would need web search access to find: (1) Academic literature on consensus decision-making effectiveness from journals like Group Decision and Negotiation, (2) Data from organizations like the Foundation for Intentional Community or Cohousing Association, (3) Case studies from specific communities like Twin Oaks, Findhorn, or cohousing developments. Without verified sources, I decline to fabricate citations. Please retry with web search permissions enabled."
