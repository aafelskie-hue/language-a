To properly research this pattern, I would need permission to search for: (1) timber frame construction programs and building codes, (2) Japanese joinery (kumiki, tsugite) traditions and contemporary applications, (3) Design for Disassembly (DfD) initiatives in wood construction, (4) Academic studies on wood joint durability vs. metal fasteners, (5) Built examples like Japanese temples (some maintained for 1000+ years through traditional joinery), European timber frame traditions, and modern timber frame buildings. The pattern concept itself is well-established historically, but I cannot provide properly sourced citations without search capabilities."
